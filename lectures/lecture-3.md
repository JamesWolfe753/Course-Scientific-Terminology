# Last Time

## The Greek Alphabet

- For the upcoming test, you should be able to recognize words written in Greek (e.g. πλαγκτόν) and be able to write out the transliterated form (plankton).
    - You do not need to know how breathing marks work.
- Remember: γ before γ, κ, ξ, or χ becomes *n*, not *g*:
    - σπόγγος = *spongos* (sponge)
- When a word has what appears to be an opening single quotation mark above a letter, it uses an h- sound.
    - ἱπποπόταμος = *hippopotamos* (hippopotamus)

## Inflection

- Words in Greek and Latin change their form to show their grammatical function.

## Gender

- Words in Greek and Latin are classified by *gender* (masculine, feminine, neuter).
- This concept is largely detached from natural *sex*.
- Read [Dirckx (1985)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1097%2F00000372-198502000-00009).

## Suffixes

- Suffixes attach to roots, and appear at the end of the word.
- They differ from prefixes in their position, but also in that they determine the word’s part of speech.
- Džuganová (1998) provides a full overview of the possibilities for affixation.
- Suffixes can be used to turn a word into an adjective, noun, or verb.

## This Class

- Introducing Greek and Latin cases.
- Current scientific use of Greek and Latin terminology.
- Greek noun-forming suffixes.

# Inflected Languages

## Inflection

- Both Greek and Latin are *inflected languages*, which means that they can express part of their meaning through a change in the final syllable of a word.

## Conjugation

- Changing the form of a verb to show its function.
- This is found to a limited degree in English.
    - I *love*, you *love*, but he *loves*.
- This is even more common in French.
    - *J'aime* means 'I love', *tu aimes* is 'you love', and so forth. The verb 'aimer' changes its form based on the person, number, mood, and tense.

## Greek Verbs

- Conjugated from one of six basic forms, called *principal parts*. Some verbs do not have all six parts, and others are irregular.
- Knowing the form of a verb found in a dictionary will not always help you.
- Greek dictionaries cite verbs in the first-person singular form (i.e. 'I love'), but English dictionaries will typically provide the infinitive form ('to love').
- Greek infinitives typically end in *-ein*; also possible are *-ai*, *-an*, *-oun*, and *-sthai*.

---

- Sometimes the form of a verb listed in a dictionary is not actually the basis for the root form in English.
- For example, if you look up *genesis* in an English dictionary, you will be told that it is from the verb γίγνεσθαι (*gignesthai*, be born or produced), but one must look up γίγνομαι (*gignomai*) in a Greek dictionary.
    - The root form, GEN- (also e.g. in pathogenic) comes from ἐγενόμην (*egenomēn*), which supplies one of the past tenses, called the *aorist*.
- If you're stuck, use the [Perseus Word Study Tool](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?la=greek) to look up a declined or conjugated form of the word.

## Declension

- Varying the form of a noun, pronoun, or adjective, in order to indicate grammatical number, gender, and case.

## Cases

- A form that a noun, adjective, or pronoun can take in order to express its relationship to other words in the sentence.
- There are very limited remnants of this in English:
    - *Who* must always be the subject of the sentence. ('Who is getting married?')
    - *Whom* must be the object. ('Whom did he marry?')
    - *Whose* is a possesive. ('Whose wedding is he attending?')
- In Greek, there are five cases: nominative, vocative, accusative, genitive, dative.

---

1. Nominative
    - The bird flies.
    - Avis fugit.
    - Ὄρνις πετεται.
2. Vocative
    - O Βird!
    - O Αvis!
    - Ὤ Ὄρνις.
3. Accusative
    - I see the bird.
    - Avem video.
    - Ὁρω την ὀρνιθα.

---

4. Genitive
    - The wing of the bird.
    - Penna avis.
    - Πτέρον ὄρνιθος.
5. Dative
    - I gave the bird a seed.
    - Avi semen dedi.
    - Ἔδωκα σπέρμα τῇ ὄρνιθι.
6. [Ablative: Latin only]
    - I hear a sound from the bird.
    - Ab ave sonitum audio.

## Greek Third-Declenion Nouns

- Like verbs, one cannot always be sure that the form in a word will actually be what is listed in a dictionary.
- In the third declension, forms other than the nominative are taken from the genitive.
- Thus, *derma, dermatos* (skin) gives us **derm**algia and hypo**derm**ic, but also **dermat**ology and **dermat**itis
- *Gastēr, gastros* (stomach) provides **gastr**ic, **gastr**itis, epi**gaster**
  
# The Heart (καρδία/cor, cordis)

![[Diagram of the Human Heart](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Diagram_of_the_human_heart_(cropped).svg)](../images/600px-Diagram_of_the_human_heart_(cropped).svg.png)

## Vena Cava

> - Latin phrase: 'hollow vein’
- Came into English in the 16th century.

## Pulmonary

> - Latin *pulmonarius*, from *pulmo, pulmon-* ‘lung’
- 17th cent.

## Tricuspid

> - *tri-* ‘three’ + *cuspis, cuspid-* ‘cusp’, 'point'
- 17th cent.

## Atrium

> - Latin: a reception hall in a Roman house
- 16th cent.

## Ventricle

> - Latin *ventriculus*, diminutive of *venter* ‘belly’
- late Middle English

## Aorta

> - Greek *aortē*, from *aeirein* ‘raise’
- 16th cent.: used in the plural by Hippocrates for the branches of the windpipe, and by Aristotle for the great artery

## Mitral

> - *mitralis*, from Latin *mitra* 'mitre' (a tall headdress worn by bishops); Greek Greek *mitra* ‘belt or turban’
- 17th cent.

## Poetic Usage

- Our use of the word 'heart' to refer to emotion comes from Greek/Latin usage, and in ancient usage was more than merely figurative.
- Galen appears to have been one of the earliest authors to use the term in opposition to the mind (as the seat of reason).
    - Discussed in the programme [*Heart vs Mind: What Makes Us Human*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bH8gQezrws#t=7m25s) (starting around 7m25s).

# Forming English Medical Terminology

## Džuganová (2013)

- Examines 'precisely worked-out and internationally standardised anatomical nomenclature' and 'quickly developing non-standardised terminologies of individual clinical branches', concentrating on the field of haematology.
- In the past, new terminology has been formed through *derivation* and *composition* from elements of Greek and Latin
    - derivation: Forming a word from the stems of other words. What we are mostly concerned with in this course.
    - composition/compounding: Adding on another word to make the term more specific (e.g. blood pressure, lifespan, gallstone).
    
## Spreading of Vocabulary

- Flows through three basic methods:
    1. forming new names
    2. forming new meanings
    3. borrowing words from other languages

---

- Or by another scheme:
    1. morphological by means of derivation, compounding, abbreviation;
    2. syntactic by forming collocations and multi-word phrases;
    3. semantic by narrowing (specifying) the meaning of common words, by metaphoric and metonymic transfer of the previous meaning;
    4. borrowing words from other languages.
- The syntactic method is now most common in the sciences (the forming of compounds, which often end up as abbreviations).
    - AIDS, for example, is the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome

## Other Terms

- acronyms: an abbreviation formed from the initial letters of other words *and pronounced as a word*, e.g. SARS (something unpronouceable is an initialism, e.g. BBC)
- synonyms: normally a word or phrase that means exactly or nearly the same as another word or phrase in the same language
    - in biology, a taxonomic name which has the same application as another, especially one which has been superseded and is no longer valid

---

- eponyms: a person after whom a discovery, invention, place, etc., is named or thought to be named
- toponyms: a name derived from the name of a place (i.e. where it was discovered)
- mythonyms: a word derived from a story
- backronym: an expansion of an existing acronym, such as 'port out, starboard home' for *posh*.
