# Last Time

## The Greek Alphabet

- For our test on 24 July, you should be able to recognize words written in Greek (e.g. πλαγκτόν) and be able to write out the transliterated form (plankton).
    - You do not need to know how breathing marks work.
- Remember: γ before γ, κ, ξ, or χ becomes *n*, not *g*:
    - σπόγγος = *spongos* (sponge)
- When a word has what appears to be an opening single quotation mark above a letter, it uses an h- sound.
    - ἱπποπόταμος = *hippopotamos* (hippopotamus)

## Adjective-Forming Suffixes

- Suffixes attach to roots, and appear at the end of the word. Like prefixes, they modify the meaning of a root, conveying a little more information.
- They differ from prefixes in their position, but also in that they determine the word’s part of speech.
- Džuganová (1998) provides a full overview of the possibilities for affixation.

## Compound Suffixes

- Compound suffixes actually contain roots within them, some of which you’ve already learned, but the appear so frequently in this form that it is useful to treat them as suffixes themselves.
    - E.g., LOG + y = -logy

## This Class

- Key concepts of inflected lanuages.
- Greek noun-forming suffixes.
- Current scientific use of Greek and Latin terminology.
- More root words.

# Inflected Languages

## Inflection

- Both Greek and Latin are *inflected languages*, which means that they can express part of their meaning through a change in the final syllable of a word.

## Conjugation

- Changing the form of a verb to show its function.
- This is found to a limited degree in English.
    - I *love*, you *love*, but he *loves*.
- This is even more common in French.
    - *J'aime* means 'I love', *tu aimes* is 'you love', and so forth. The verb 'aimer' changes its form based on the person, number, mood, and tense.

## Greek Verbs

- Conjugated from one of six basic forms, called *principal parts*. Some verbs do not have all six parts, and others are irregular.
- Knowing the form of a verb found in a dictionary will not always help you.
- Greek dictionaries cite verbs in the first-person singular form (i.e. 'I love'), but English dictionaries will typically provide the infinitive form ('to love').
- Greek infinitives typically end in *-ein*; also possible are *-ai*, *-an*, *-oun*, and *-sthai*.

---

- Sometimes the form of a verb listed in a dictionary is not actually the basis for the root form in English.
- For example, if you look up *genesis* in an English dictionary, you will be told that it is from the verb γίγνεσθαι (*gignesthai*, be born or produced), but one must look up γίγνομαι (*gignomai*) in a Greek dictionary.
    - The root form, GEN- (also e.g. in pathogenic) comes from ἐγενόμην (*egenomēn*), which supplies one of the past tenses, called the *aorist*.
- If you're stuck, use the [Perseus Word Study Tool](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?la=greek) to look up a declined or conjugated form of the word.

## Declension

- Varying the form of a noun, pronoun, or adjective, in order to indicate grammatical number, gender, and case.

## Cases

- A form that a noun, adjective, or pronoun can take in order to express its relationship to other words in the sentence.
- There are very limited remnants of this in English:
    - *Who* must always be the subject of the sentence. ('Who is getting married?')
    - *Whom* must be the object. ('Whom did he marry?')
    - *Whose* is a possesive. ('Whose wedding is he attending?')
- In Greek, there are five cases: nominative, vocative, accusative, genitive, dative.

---

1. Nominative
    - The bird flies.
    - Avis fugit.
    - Ὄρνις πετεται.
2. Vocative
    - O Βird!
    - O Αvis!
    - Ὤ Ὄρνις.
3. Accusative
    - I see the bird.
    - Avem video.
    - Ὁρω την ὀρνιθα.

---

4. Genitive
    - The wing of the bird.
    - Penna avis.
    - Πτέρον ὄρνιθος.
5. Dative
    - I gave the bird a seed.
    - Avi semen dedi.
    - Ἔδωκα σπέρμα τῇ ὄρνιθι.
6. [Ablative: Latin only]
    - I hear a sound from the bird.
    - Ab ave sonitum audio.

## Greek Third-Declenion Nouns

- Like verbs, one cannot always be sure that the form in a word will actually be what is listed in a dictionary.
- In the third declension, forms other than the nominative are taken from the genitive.
- Thus, *derma, dermatos* (skin) gives us **derm**algia and hypo**derm**ic, but also **dermat**ology and **dermat**itis
- *Gastēr, gastros* (stomach) provides **gastr**ic, **gastr**itis, epi**gaster**

# Forming English Medical Terminology

## Džuganová (2013)

- Examines 'precisely worked-out and internationally standardised anatomical nomenclature' and 'quickly developing non-standardised terminologies of individual clinical branches', concentrating on the field of haematology.
- In the past, new terminology has been formed through *derivation* and *composition* from elements of Greek and Latin
    - derivation: Forming a word from the stems of other words. What we are mostly concerned with in this course.
    - composition/compounding: Adding on another word to make the term more specific (e.g. blood pressure, lifespan, gallstone).
    
## Spreading of Vocabulary

- Flows through three basic methods:
    1. forming new names
    2. forming new meanings
    3. borrowing words from other languages

---

- Or by another scheme:
    1. morphological by means of derivation, compounding, abbreviation;
    2. syntactic by forming collocations and multi-word phrases;
    3. semantic by narrowing (specifying) the meaning of common words, by metaphoric and metonymic transfer of the previous meaning;
    4. borrowing words from other languages.
- The syntactic method is now most common in the sciences (the forming of compounds, which often end up as abbreviations).
    - AIDS, for example, is the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome

## Other Terms

- acronyms: an abbreviation formed from the initial letters of other words *and pronounced as a word*, e.g. SARS (something unpronouceable is an initialism, e.g. BBC)
- synonyms: normally a word or phrase that means exactly or nearly the same as another word or phrase in the same language
    - in biology, a taxonomic name which has the same application as another, especially one which has been superseded and is no longer valid

---

- eponyms: a person after whom a discovery, invention, place, etc., is named or thought to be named
- toponyms: a name derived from the name of a place (i.e. where it was discovered)
- mythonyms: a word derived from a story
- backronym: an expansion of an existing acronym, such as 'port out, starboard home' for *posh*.

## Marečková et al. (2002)

- Demonstrate that Latin is still a primary means of commmunication: they examine anatomical nomenclature, terms in clinical medicine, and pharmaceutical terminology.
- Notes the attitude that it doesn't necessarily matter (and might even be preferable) if the patient does not know what the term means.
    - Pliny the Elder: the Roman people 'believe less what regards their own health, if they understand'
- Outlines the development of the *Terminologia Anatomica* (International Anatomical Terminology).
