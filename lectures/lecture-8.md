# Final Assignment

## Vocabulary Analysis Paper

- A slightly more advanced version of your weekly vocabulary analyses:
    1. Select twenty terms from two recent (2014) articles in peer-reviewed scientific journals.
    2. Analyse their etymology and meaning, showing their breakdown into individual roots (as in the vocabulary list). 
- [Full details on the course website.](http://adunning.github.io/latin-greek-scientific-terminology/assignments/vocabulary-analysis-paper/)

---

- You should use at least three professional dictionaries (or other appropriate scholarly sources; a bibliography will be distributed) to support your findings. Sources are only acceptable if they have gone through a peer-review process (any academic dictionary).

---

- Articles must be fully cited using either the author-date system of the [*Chicago Manual of Style*](http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/) (used in the syllabus) or another style relevant to your discipline.
- Must be written in a prose format (i.e. not point-form).

# Medieval Contributions to Science

## Isidore of Seville: How *not* to write etymologies

- Isidore of Seville was a bishop living in seventh-century Spain; his book *Etymologies* (*Origines*) was a very popular reference work in the Middle Ages.

## Trans. by Dirckx (2007)

> Frenesis is so called either because it is a disorder of the mind (G. *phrenes*) or because its victims grind their teeth (L. *frendere* 'to gnash the teeth'). This is a form of mental disturbance with violent behavior and dementia, a choleric affliction.

---

> Hydrophobia is literally ‘fear of water’ (Gr. *hydor* ‘water’, *phobos* ‘fear’); compare the Latin term *morbus lymphaticus*, from *lympha* ‘water’. This is caused by the bite of a mad dog, or even by coming into contact with its saliva spilled on the ground, which will provoke either man or beast to madness and rage.

---

> Epilemsia amounts to an attack or assault (Gr. *epilepsia*) on both mind and body. It arises from a superabundance of black bile acting on the brain. It is also called the falling (Lat. *caduca*) sickness because during an attack the patient falls down. Lay persons call victims of this disorder *lunatici* because they imagine that the demons follow the phases of the moon in playing their tricks, and also *larvatici*. Still other names are the great, divine, or comitial disease. Great it certainly is, in that it can make a healthy man fall down and foam at the mouth. It is called comitialis because, in pagan times, if someone had such an attack on a day set aside for a public assembly [Lat. *comitium*], the assembly was postponed. Among the Romans such a day was set aside each year in January.

---

> Vertigo means a whirlwind that stirs up earth and throws it around. In the vertex of the human body, arteries and veins can likewise stir up a wind from undue moisture and relaxation, and cause the eyes to spin, and that too we call vertigo.

---

> Cancer, Latin for ‘crab’, is named for its similarity to the sea creature. According to the physicians, no medicine can cure such a lesion. Although the part in which it arises is often excised so as to prolong the patient’s life, death nonetheless eventually ensues.
