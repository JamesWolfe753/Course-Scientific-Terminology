# Pluralization

## Dirckx and Leider (1981)

- When dealing with Latin nouns and adjectives in their original form, there are several different ways of pluralizing them.
- This follows a consistent pattern, follows the word's declension and gender (i.e. grammatical categorization).
- Words that have been anglicized, on the other hand, tend to follow English conventions.
    - For example, the correct Latin plural of *apparatus* (fourth declension, masculine) is *apparatus*, but in English it more typically *apparatuses*.

---

- How can you figure this out without memorizing the full forms of Latin words and the tables of declensions? A medical dictionary such as Taber's will provide the plural forms for technical words.
- Failing that, use the [Perseus Word Study Tool](http://perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?la=latin), which will tell you the word's declension, gender, and case. If necessary, you can then look up a table of Latin nouns (as the one in this article) to find out what form the plural takes.

## First Declension

- *-a* (occasionally *-e*) becomes *-ae*.
- Feminine and masculine words have the same form.
- areola, areolae; fossa, fossae; lamina, laminae

## Second Declension

- Masculine: *-us* and *-er* (occasionally *-os*) become *-i*.
- Neuter: *-um* (occasionally *-on*) becomes *-a*.
- cactus, cacti; sulcus, sulci; bacillus, bacilli
- puer, pueri; ager, agri

## Third Declension
- Masculine and feminine: words with various endings are pluralized with *-es*.
- Neuter: plural in *-a*.
- These are words in which the declined form is based on the genitive (possessive) form rather than the typical nominative form (i.e. the form the word takes when it is the subject).
- For example, the plural of *mens* (genitive *mentis*) is *mentes*.
- viscus (visceris), viscera; corpus (corporis), corpora; crus (cruris), crura

## Fourth Declension

- Masculine and feminine: *-us* remains *-us*.
- Neuter: *-u* becomes *-a*.
- ductus, ductus; fetus, fetus; meatus, meatus

## Fifth Declension
