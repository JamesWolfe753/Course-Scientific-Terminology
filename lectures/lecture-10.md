## Prefixes

> **Di**cynodonts are an **ex**clusively herbivorous clade of synapsids.

---

They **com**prise more than 100 species that are known from the Middle Permian the Late Triassic periods Dicynodonts were morphologically **dis**parate and **pre**sented a wide range of sizes and putative ecological niches, **in**cluding semi-aquatic, fossorial, arboreal and grazing.

---

**De**spite over 150 years of **di**cynodont research, several paleobiological aspects of the neuroanatomy, inner ear morphology and **inter**nal cranium anatomy remain practically **ob**scure.

---

Moreover, because the **de**structive technique of serial sampling was the primary way to access the **inter**nal anatomy of **di**cynodont skulls, the data available for various taxa was **in**consistent and rarely subjected to synthetic treatments. 

---

As a **re**sult, details of **inter**nal skull anatomy have been overlooked in **re**cent phylogenetic analyses. Only Surkov and Benton **in**cluded a large number of braincase characters in a phylogenetic analysis of **di**cynodonts.

---

**Re**cent **ad**vances in non-destructive imaging techniques such as high resolution **com**puted tomography, neutron tomography, and synchrotron radiation based micro-computed tomography, hold the potential to **pro**vide significant new **in**sight **in**to fossil skull morphology. However, the **ap**plication of such techniques to **di**cynodonts has been limited.

## in
- 'into', 'on'

## de-
- ‘down’, ‘away’, ‘off’, ‘thoroughly’

## di-, dis-
- ‘apart’, ‘in different directions’, ‘thoroughly

## con
- ‘with’, ‘together’, ‘very’

## ex-

## Wood Roots

The sheep used in these **experiments** were cared as per outlined in the Guide for the Care and **Use** of **Animals** in **Agricultural** Research and Teaching **Consortium** [8]. Thirty **affected** and 30 **unaffected** sheep were slaughtered with **electrical** stunning then **exsanguination** ....

---

The **study** **area** was located in a region **adjoined** by the **provinces** of Guizhou, Yunnan, and Sichuan (26°56'-27°47' N, 103°56'-104°51' E), with the average **elevation** 2100 m above the sea **level**, the **annual** **precipitation** 956 mm, and the average **atmospheric temperature** 9–11°C.

---

The **main** grassland **species** **include** Puccinellia (*Chinam **poensis** ohuji*), Siberian **Nitraria** (***Nitraria*** sibirica ***pall***), **Floriated astragalus** (***Astragalus floridus***), **Poly-branched astragals** (*A.* ***polycladus***), **Falcate** whin (***Oxytropis falcate***), Ewenki **automomous** banner (***Elymus nutans***), **Common leymus** (***Leymus secalinus***), and June grass (***Koeleria cristata***).

---

Most of the **plants** are **herbaceous** and good **resources** for grazing **animals**.

# Verb-Forming Suffixes

## -ate
- ‘to make’, ‘to treat’, ‘to do something with’
- alleviate, obviate, illuminate
- NB: This suffix often combines with the noun-forming suffix -ion (e.g. illumination)

## -fy
- ‘to make’, ‘to cause’
- terrify, liquify, pacify
- NB: The adjective ending that corresponds to -fy is -fic, ‘making’, ‘causing’ (e.g. terrific, pacific)

## -igate, -egate
- ‘to make’, ‘to drive’
- mitigate, fumigate, navigate, variegate

## -esce
- ‘to begin’, ‘to be somewhat’
- effervescent, convalescent, arborescent

# Declensions

## Inflection
- Inflection is the changing of a word’s form to reflect its grammatical role in a sentence.
- Like Greek, Latin is a highly inflected language. The form of a word can vary based on gender, number and case (nouns and adjectives) or on person, number, tense and mood (verbs).
- We will learn how how to decline some Latin nouns and adjectives in two out of six cases.

## Cases
- The nominative case is used for the subject of a sentence. This is the a word’s dictionary form.
- The genitive case is used for a word that depends on another. It can usually be translated using the word ‘of’.
- Each case also has singular and plural forms. For example:
    - lingua (nom. sing.) = ‘tongue’
    - linguae (nom. plur.) = ‘tongues’
    - linguae (gen. sing.) = ‘of the tongue’
    - linguarum (gen. plur.) = ‘of the tongues’

## Genders
- In Latin, nouns are masculine, feminine or neuter. For our purposes, you can always infer the gender of a noun from its ending (though in fact real Latin is not so regular).
- The first declension is made up of words ending in ‘-a’, which are nearly always feminine.
- The second declension is made up of words ending in ‘-us’, which are nearly always masculine, and words ending in ‘-um’, which are neuter.

## First declension

| 	         |   Singular    	    | Plural                |
| -----------|----------------------|-----------------------|
| Nominative |	-a (e.g. lingua)	| -ae (e.g. linguae) |
| Genitive   |	-ae (e.g. linguae)  | -arum (e.g. linguarum) |

## Second declension (masculine)

| 	         |   Singular    	    | Plural                |
| -----------|----------------------|-----------------------|
| Nominative |	-us (e.g. nervus)	| -i (e.g. nervi) |
| Genitive   |	-i (e.g. nervi)  | -orum (e.g. nervorum) |

## Second declension (neuter)

| 	         |   Singular    	    | Plural                |
| -----------|----------------------|-----------------------|
| Nominative |	-um (e.g. labium)	| -a (e.g. labia) |
| Genitive   |	-i (e.g. labii)  | -orum (e.g. labiorum) |

---

- Thus *arcus costarum* is ‘arch of the ribs’ and *venae oculi* is ‘the veins of the eye’
- NB: Latin has neither the definite (‘the’) nor the indefinite (‘a/an’) article. Therefore *vena* may be translated as ‘vein’, ‘a vein’ or ‘the vein’, whichever seems appropriate.

## Adjectives

- Latin adjectives must agree in gender (masculine, feminine or neuter), number (plural or singular) and case with the adjectives they modify. In real Latin, adjectives can be placed almost anywhere in a sentence, but in scientific expressions they usually follow the noun the modify.
- The adjectives you will see belong to a group that takes the endings of the first or the second declension, as longus, -a, -um
- Thus we could have *nervus longus, lingua longa,* or *labium longum.*

# Example Phrases

## *camera oculi*
- chamber of the eye

## *musculus flexor digiti quinti*
- the muscle (that is the) bender of the fifth finger

## *bursae subcutaneae*
- subcutaneous bags; bags under the skin

# Problems in Modern Scientific Communication

## Case Study: The Discovery of Germs

- See ['Blood and Guts', ep. 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErpMhBiVyrc#t=42m46s), starting at 42m46s: discusses Ignaz Semmelweis and Louis Pasteur.
- Book published in 1861, [*Die Ätiologie, der Begriff und die Prophylaxe des Kindbettfiebers*](http://www.deutschestextarchiv.de/book/show/semmelweis_kindbettfieber_1861) (*The Aetiology, Concept, and Prophylaxis of Childbed Fever*).
- Would you be convinced of the argument for a change of practice?

---

- How could the following passage from Semmelweis be made clearer?

> The only cause of childbed fever is decaying animal-organic matter that is either introduced to the individual from external sources or generated internally. Thus, the prophylaxis of childbed fever involves preventing the introduction of external decaying matter, preventing the internal generation of decaying matter, and removing as quickly as possible any existing decaying matter or preventing its resorption. (trans. K. Codell Carter, p. 163)

---

- Terms used in the title of the book are superficially precise, but mask an uncertainty about the cause:
    - *aetiology* is from Greek *aitiologia*, from *aitia* ‘a cause’ + *-logia*; 
    - *prophylaxis* is from Greek *phulaxis*, ‘act of guarding’.
- What happens when we lack terminology to describe observed phenomena?

# Pluralization

## Dirckx and Leider (1981)

- When dealing with Latin nouns and adjectives in their original form, there are several different ways of pluralizing them.
- This follows a consistent pattern, follows the word's declension and gender (i.e. grammatical categorization).
- Words that have been anglicized, on the other hand, tend to follow English conventions.
    - For example, the correct Latin plural of *apparatus* (fourth declension, masculine) is *apparatus*, but in English it more typically *apparatuses*.

---

- How can you figure this out without memorizing the full forms of Latin words and the tables of declensions? A medical dictionary such as Taber's will provide the plural forms for technical words.
- Failing that, use the [Perseus Word Study Tool](http://perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?la=latin), which will tell you the word's declension, gender, and case. If necessary, you can then look up a table of Latin nouns (as the one in this article) to find out what form the plural takes.

## First Declension

- *-a* (occasionally *-e*) becomes *-ae*.
- Feminine and masculine words have the same form.
- areola, areolae; fossa, fossae; lamina, laminae

## Second Declension

- Masculine: *-us* and *-er* (occasionally *-os*) become *-i*.

- cactus, cacti; sulcus, sulci; bacillus, bacilli
- puer, pueri; ager, agri

## Third Declension
- Masculine and feminine: words with various endings are pluralized with *-es*.
- Neuter: plural in *-a*.
- These are words in which the declined form is based on the genitive (possessive) form rather than the typical nominative form (i.e. the form the word takes when it is the subject).
- For example, the plural of *mens* (genitive *mentis*) is *mentes*.
- viscus (visceris), viscera; corpus (corporis), corpora; crus (cruris), crura

## Fourth Declension

- Masculine and feminine: *-us* remains *-us*.
- Neuter: *-u* becomes *-a*.
- ductus, ductus; fetus, fetus; meatus, meatus

## Fifth Declension
- Masculine and feminine: *-es* remains *-es*.
- canities, canities; scabies, scabies
