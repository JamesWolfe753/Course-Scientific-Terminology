# Introduction

## Last Time

- Examined the content of the course (everything is on the syllabus).
- Introduced common Greek prefixes.
- Looked at Turmezei (2012).

## This Class

- Introducing the Greek alphabet.
- Examining the idea of an inflected language.
- Looking at adjective-forming suffixes and compound suffixes.
- Introducing more root forms.

## Turmezei (2012)

- Explained that about 89 per cent of anatomical vocabulary comes from Greek and Latin.
    - Breakdown: Classical Latin (62%), Classical Greek (24%), Old English (7%), Post-Classical Latin (3%), other (4%).
- Gives you a sense of how words are formed through various examples.

## Dirckx (2006)

- Great reference page that covers the basics of what you absolutely need to know for using scientific terminology responsibly.
- You will not be tested on pronunciation.

## Learning Strategies

- Flashcards are excellent for memorizing vocabulary.
- Speaking words aloud can make them easier to recall.
- Rehearse vocabulary even in spare moments (on the bus, in the shower, while you’re doing the dishes).

---

- Make sure you think about meaning. When you’re learning the elements of a word and its definition, consider what the elements of a word have to do with its meaning. This way, your recall will be better and the you’ll remember the word for longer.

# Inflected Languages

## Inflection

- Both Greek and Latin are *inflected languages*, which means that they can express part of their meaning through a change in the final syllable of a word.

## Conjugation

- Changing the form of a verb to show its function.
- This is found to a limited degree in English.
    - I *love*, you *love*, but he *loves*.
- This is even more common in French.
    - *J'aime* means 'I love', *tu aimes* is 'you love', and so forth. The verb *aimer* changes its form based on the person, number, mood, and tense.

## Declension

- Varying the form of a noun, pronoun, or adjective, in order to indicate grammatical number, gender, and case.

## Cases

- A form that a noun, adjective, or pronoun can take in order to express its relationship to other words in the sentence.
- There are very limited remnants of this in English:
    - *Who* must always be the subject of the sentence. ('Who is getting married?')
    - *Whom* must be the object. ('Whom did he marry?')
    - *Whose* is a possesive. ('Whose wedding is he attending?')

# Gender

## What is gender?

- A further method of classifying nouns and pronouns and showing how words are associated.
- Widely used in Indo-European languages, such as Latin, French, and German.
- To be distinguished from *sex*: grammatical gender is only loosely associated with distinctions one might assume.
- Good discussion as it applies in the sciences by [Dirckx (1985)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1097%2F00000372-198502000-00009).
- Possible to show different genders of a word either by changing the word entirely or by keeping the same root and changing the ending.
- People can get very worked up about this.

## 1. Using a different root

## Individuals

- English: man/woman
- French: homme/femme
- German: Mann/Frau
- Greek: anēr/gunē
- Latin: vir/mulier

## Monarchs

- English: king/queen
- French: roi/reine
- German: König/Königin
- Greek: basileus/basileia
- Latin: rex/regina

## 2. Changing the ending

- For Latin words in the nominative case (appearing directly most commonly in scientific terminology):
    - words ending in *-a* are mostly feminine (*aqua,* water; *terra,* earth; *rosa,* rose; but *nauta*, sailor, is masculine);
	- *-us* words are mostly masculine (*hortus,* garden; *rivus,* stream)
	- *-um* words are always neuter (*monumentum,* monument).

# Greek Adjective-Forming Suffixes

## What is a suffix?

- Suffixes attach to roots, and appear at the end of the word. Like prefixes, they modify the meaning of a root, conveying a little more information.
- They differ from prefixes in their position, but also in that they determine the word’s part of speech. We will see roots that form adjectives, nouns and verbs.
- Džuganová (1998) provides a full overview of the possibilities for affixation.

## New Suffixes

- More than one suffix (or prefix) can be found in a single word.
    - LOG, ‘reason’ + -ic, ‘pertaining to’ = Logic
    - LOG, ‘reason’ + -ic, ‘pertaining to’ + -al, ‘pertaining to’ = logical (‘pertaining to / having to do with what pertains to reasoning’)
