# Last Time

## Inflected Languages

- Examined basic concepts of inflected languages: background information to help you avoid embarrassing mistakes and make better use of dictionaries (important for the final assignment).
- You need to understand for the purposes of the test:
    - that, due to the processes of inflection, slightly different forms of stems can refer to the same original word;
    - that the endings of words can dramatically change their meaning.

---

- Introduced Greek noun-forming suffixes.
- Read Džuganová (2013), who explains how terminology has been created in the past, and how it tends to be created today; Marečková et al. (2002), who analyse the current role of Latin in medicine.

# Test One

## What do you need to know?

- Learn the prefixes, roots, and suffixes from the first five lectures, all found in the online vocabulary list.
    - If you want additional examples of terminology using these stems, you can look at Ayers, lessons 1–18.
- You are responsible for knowing the meaning of terms on the list that can be composed of the elements you have learned; questions on these, however, will be multiple choice, *vel sim.* (or something similar).
- No terms will appear on your test of which you have not learned all the constituent elements in the lessons covered so far.

---

- There will be a handful of questions in which you will be asked to transliterate Greek words into Latin characters. They will be words with very close English equivalents, as we have been looking at in class; if you want something to practice on, I have provided a list on the Learning Portal.
- There will be a few other questions (multiple choice) drawn from the readings for the class.
- Your main focus in studying should be on the vocabulary.

- The test will be one hour in length.
- There will be a short lesson beforehand. Material introduced in this lesson will not appear on the test.
- We will have a short practice quiz (non-credit) on Tuesday.

1. ANTHROP-

# Greek Verb-Forming Suffixes

## What is a verb-forming suffix?

- These suffixes form verbs when they are added to the end of a word.
- There are two of them, and only one is really Greek.

## -ize
- ‘to make’, ‘to treat’, ‘to do something with’
- CARBON-, ‘coal’ + -ize = carbonize
- syn- + CHRON-, ‘time’ + -ize = synchronize
- ant(i) + AGON-, ‘to struggle’ + -ize = antagonize

## -ate
- ‘to make’, ‘to treat’, ‘to do something with’
- GYR-, ‘circle’ + -ate = gyrate
- AER-, ‘air’ + -ate = aerate
- de- + HYDR- + -ate = dehydrate

## 'Advertise', not 'advertize'

- In the United Kingdom, words that end in -ize in Canada [are often spelled -ise](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/words/ize-ise-or-yse) (e.g. *organise* rather than *organize*).
- Some verbs, however, must always be spelled -ise, because they are not using the -ize suffix, but are writing -ise as part of a longer word element. For example:
    - -cise (meaning ‘cutting’) in the word *excise*;
    - -prise (meaning ‘taking’) as in *surprise*;
    - –mise (meaning ‘sending’) as in *promise*.

---

- Common words that must end in *-ise* include:
    - advertise
    - advise
    - arise
    - chastise
    - compromise
    - devise
    - disguise
    - enterprise
    - exercise
    - improvise
    - incise
    - promise
    - revise
    - supervise
    - surmise
    - surprise

## Verbs in -yse

- There are also a few verbs that always end in -yse in British English, and can also be spelled -yze in Canadian English (both are correct).
- These words do not come directly from Greek, but were created (mostly in the nineteenth century) on the basis of *analyse*, which seems to have been a back-formation from *analysis*:
    - breathalyse
    - catalyse
    - dialyse
    - electrolyse
    - hydrolyse
    - paralyse
    - psychoanalyse

## Thorax

- The sort of description you should aim for in your final paper:

> In ancient Greece, *thorax* was the armor, the metallic or skin covering for the protection of the chest and the back of the warriors. Hippocrates was the first one who used the term *thorax* to describe the anatomical area protected by this armour. Since then, the word thorax is being used unaltered in medical terminology. Derivatives of this term are many words, such as thoracic, thoracotomy (thorax and -tomy), thoracopagus (thorax and -pagus ['fixed']), thoracoscopy (thorax and -scopy), or in complex words, such as pneumothorax (pneuma ['the air'] and thorax) …

# Greek Plurals

## How are Greek plurals formed?

- Many English words that are derived from Greek still retain their Greek plural forms (as do many words derived from Latin).
- Often, you can predict them based on a few simple rules. Sometimes, however you cannot: for example, ‘octopus’ can give the plural ‘octopodes’! (‘Octopuses’ is, however, now more common. ‘Octopi’, which would follow the rules for some Latin plurals, is incorrect.)

## singular *-ma*, plural *-mata*
- *one* exanthema, *many* exanthemata
- carcinoma, *pl.* carcinomata
- trauma, *pl.* traumata

- Both ‘carcinomas’ and ‘traumas’ are, however, acceptable English plurals.

- synthesis, *pl.* syntheses
- diagnosis, *pl.* diagnoses

## singular *-on*, plural *-a*

- protozoon, *pl.* protozoa

## singular *-itis*, plural *-itides*
- meningitis, *pl.* meningitides
- arthritis, *pl.* arthritides
