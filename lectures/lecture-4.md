# Last Time

## Inflected Languages

- Examined basic concepts of inflected languages: background information to help you avoid embarrassing mistakes and make better use of dictionaries (important for the final assignment).
- You need to understand for the purposes of the test:
    - that, due to the processes of inflection, slightly different forms of stems can refer to the same original word;
    - that the endings of words can dramatically change their meaning.

---

- Introduced Greek noun-forming suffixes.
- Read
    - Džuganová (2013), who explains how terminology has been created in the past, and how it tends to be created today;
    - Dirckx (2001), on singular and plural forms of words (which we will discuss further today and later in the term).

# Test One

## What do you need to know?

- Learn the prefixes, roots, and suffixes from the first five lectures, all found in the online vocabulary list.
    - If you want additional examples of terminology using these stems, you can look at Ayers, lessons 1–18.
- You are responsible for knowing the meaning of terms on the list that can be composed of the elements you have learned; questions on these, however, will be multiple choice, *vel sim.* (or something similar).
- No terms will appear on your test of which you have not learned all the constituent elements in the lessons covered so far.

---

- There will be a handful of questions in which you will be asked to transliterate Greek words into Latin characters. They will be words with very close English equivalents, as we have been looking at in class; if you want something to practice on, see the 'Familiar Greek Words' list on the course website.
- There will be a few other questions (multiple choice) drawn from the readings for the class.
- Your main focus in studying should be on the vocabulary.

- The test will be one hour in length.
- There will be a short lesson beforehand. Material introduced in this lesson will not appear on the test.
- We will have a short practice quiz (non-credit) next class.

## Sample Questions

- Give at least one English translation for each of the following Greek bases:

1. ANTHROP-
2. MELAN-
3. HELIC-, HELIX

---

- Give at least one English translation for each of the following Greek bases:

1. ANTHROP-

# Greek Diminutive Suffixes

## What is a diminutive suffix?

- Diminutive suffixes are normal noun-forming suffixes.
- Every diminutive suffix gives the meaning ‘little’. That’s why they’re called ‘diminutive’!

---

- In English, examples include:
    - cat → kitten
    - bull → bullock
    - small → smallish
    - kitchen → kitchenette
    - pig → piglet

## -ium, -ion
- ‘little’
- BACTER-ium, ‘little rod’ (*bacteria* is plural)
- POD-ium, ‘little foot’ (tube foot of echinoderm)
- THEC-ium, ‘little case’ (the spore-bearing layer in fungi’)
- STOM-ion, ‘little mouth’ (the midpoint of the oral fissure determined with the lips closed)

## -idium, -idion
- ‘little’
- CONI, ‘dust’ + -idium = conidium, a spore produced asexually by various fungi
- BAS-, 'base' + -idium = basidium, a microscopic club-shaped spore-bearing structure produced by certain fungi
- PLAST-, ‘to mould’ + -idion = plastidion, any of various small bodies of specialized protoplasm lying in the cytoplasm of cells

## -arium, -arion
- ‘little’
- CON-, ‘cone’ + -arium = conarium, pineal body
- HIPP-, ‘horse’ + -arion = Hipparion, a genus of extinct three-toed mammals related to horses

## -isk, -iscus

- MEN-, ‘moon’ + -iscus = meniscus, a crescent or crescentic body

# Greek Verb-Forming Suffixes

## What is a verb-forming suffix?

- These suffixes form verbs when they are added to the end of a word.
- There are two of them, and only one is really Greek.

## -ize
- ‘to make’, ‘to treat’, ‘to do something with’
- CARBON-, ‘coal’ + -ize = carbonize
- syn- + CHRON-, ‘time’ + -ize = synchronize
- ant(i) + AGON-, ‘to struggle’ + -ize = antagonize

## -ate
- ‘to make’, ‘to treat’, ‘to do something with’
- GYR-, ‘circle’ + -ate = gyrate
- AER-, ‘air’ + -ate = aerate
- de- + HYDR- + -ate = dehydrate

## 'Advertise', not 'advertize'

- In the United Kingdom, words that end in -ize in Canada [are often spelled -ise](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/words/ize-ise-or-yse) (e.g. *organise* rather than *organize*).
- Some verbs, however, must always be spelled -ise, because they are not using the -ize suffix, but are writing -ise as part of a longer word element. For example:
    - -cise (meaning ‘cutting’) in the word *excise*;
    - -prise (meaning ‘taking’) as in *surprise*;
    - –mise (meaning ‘sending’) as in *promise*.

---

- Common words that must end in *-ise* include:
    - advertise
    - advise
    - arise
    - chastise
    - compromise
    - devise
    - disguise
    - enterprise
    - exercise
    - improvise
    - incise
    - promise
    - revise
    - supervise
    - surmise
    - surprise

## Verbs in -yse

- There are also a few verbs that always end in -yse in British English, and can also be spelled -yze in Canadian English (both are correct).
- These words do not come directly from Greek, but were created (mostly in the nineteenth century) on the basis of *analyse*, which seems to have been a back-formation from *analysis*:
    - breathalyse
    - catalyse
    - dialyse
    - electrolyse
    - hydrolyse
    - paralyse
    - psychoanalyse

# Analysing Ancient Accounts of Disease

## Plague in the Ancient World

- Authors clearly modelled their writings on actual events, but also imitated one another's descriptions.
- One needs to be somewhat wary of making a scientific diagnosis based on a historical account, at least until one understands more about the context.
- Translations of various accounts in Dirckx (2000a; 2000b).

## Homer

> Apollo, who was angry with Agamemnon for his shameful treatment of the priest Chryses, sent a dire plague against the king's army, and spread death among the people. *Iliad* I:9–12.

> First he smote down the mules and the wild dogs, and then he turned his stinging arrows against mankind. And thickly burned the funeral pyres. *Iliad* I:50–52.

## Sophocles

> *Chorus.* Alas! My sorrows are beyond measure! The whole city is stricken with a pestilence against which human resources seem powerless. The noble earth no longer brings forth its fruits, and women in labor no longer bring forth children…. Deaths beyond all counting have devastated the populace. Corpses lie everywhere, unmourned, harbouring the seeds of death. Here young wives, there grey-haired mothers send up their shrieks of grief at the altar steps. *Oedipus the King* I:167–185.

## Thucydides

> I take it that everyone, whether physician or layman, is at liberty to express an opinion about this epidemic, to speculate as to its origins, and to suggest reasons why it proved so devastating. My purpose here is simply to record the events as they occurred, so that if the same disease breaks out again, any observer who is equipped with this information cannot fail to recognize it. I might mention that I not only observed the ravages of the disease in others but contracted it myself. […]

## More

- Lucretius: Probably copying Thucydides.
- Virgil: Provides a detailed account of a disease that can be identified as anthrax.
- Ovid: Reusing Virgil?
- Seneca: recasting Sophocles for readers in Latin.

- Keep in mind context of writing (verse/prose; audience); differences inherent between oral and manuscript cultures and approach to knowledge in the present day.
- For more, read Karenberg and Moog (2004); Eisenstein (2005).

# Greek Plurals

## How are Greek plurals formed?

- Many English words that are derived from Greek still retain their Greek plural forms (as do many words derived from Latin).
- Often, you can predict them based on a few simple rules. Sometimes, however you cannot: for example, ‘octopus’ can give the plural ‘octopodes’! (‘Octopuses’ is, however, now more common. ‘Octopi’, which would follow the rules for some Latin plurals, is incorrect.)

## singular *-ma*, plural *-mata*
- *one* exanthema, *many* exanthemata
- carcinoma, *pl.* carcinomata
- trauma, *pl.* traumata

- Both ‘carcinomas’ and ‘traumas’ are, however, acceptable English plurals.

## singular *-sis*, plural *-ses*
- analysis, *pl.* analyses
- synthesis, *pl.* syntheses
- diagnosis, *pl.* diagnoses

## singular *-on*, plural *-a*
- phenomenon, *pl.* phenomena
- criterion, *pl.* criteria
- protozoon, *pl.* protozoa

## singular *-itis*, plural *-itides*
- meningitis, *pl.* meningitides
- arthritis, *pl.* arthritides

- Only found in technical usage.

## singular *-x*, plural *-ces* (*when preceded by a vowel*)
- thorax, *pl.* thoraces (*or* thoraxes)
- helix, *pl.* helices

# [Associations between active commuting, body fat, and body mass index](http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmj.g4887)

---

The beneficial effects of physical activity on obesity and related health outcomes are generally well understood. In high and middle income countries however, lifestyles have become increasingly sedentary, and physical inactivity has become the fourth leading risk factor for premature mortality. Declining rates of functional active travel have contributed to this population-level decrease in physical activity, and ecological evidence suggests that rising levels of obesity are more pronounced in settings with greater declines in active travel. Active commuting to work has been strongly recommended by the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) as a feasible way of incorporating greater levels of physical activity into daily life. Data from the 2011 census show that in England and Wales 23.7 million individuals regularly commute to a workplace – more than half of the 41.1 million adults of working age covered by the census.
