</ul>
<h2 id="content">Content</h2>
<ul>
<li>The exam is cumulative, drawing on material from both the Greek and Latin portions of the course.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="evolving-meanings">Evolving Meanings</h1>
<h2 id="change-and-decay">Change and Decay</h2>
<ul>
<li>Meaning is not static or straightforward. As we have seen, one word does not always mean the same thing every time it is used.</li>
<li>Just like meanings can vary from one occurrence of a word to another, they can vary over time.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="metaphor">Metaphor</h2>
<ul>
<li>META-PHOR (Greek μεταϕορά) is a transfer of meaning.</li>
<li>Thus ‘gland’ comes from the Latin word for ‘acorn’, but structures that were thought to look like acorns took that name as well, owing to the resemblance.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mythology">Mythology</h2>
<ul>
<li>Many English words, both in technical and non-technical language, take their name from Classical Mythology.</li>
<li>Thus we have ‘aphrodisiac’ from Aphrodite, ‘narcissism’ from Narcissus, and the ‘Achilles tendon’ from the hero of the <em>Iliad</em>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-history-of-science">The History of Science</h2>
<ul>
<li>Science itself is not static. Not only are new discoveries made all the time, but old theories and, indeed, entire paradigms are sometimes overthrown.</li>
<li>Many words are left behind by discarded theories. Thus we have ‘sanguine’ and ‘melancholic’ from the theory of the four humours.</li>
<li>Similarly, ‘disaster’, ‘lunacy’ and ‘jovial’ can all be traced to the belief in astrology.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="linguistic-change">Linguistic change</h2>
<ul>
<li>Not only can the meanings of words change substantially, but so can their forms. Not all words with a Greek or Latin origin were deliberately coined by scholars; some of them just evolved over time, and with this comes change.
<ul>
<li>Thus ‘date’ (the fruit, that is) comes from the Greek DACTYL.</li>
<li>‘Almond’ actually comes from the Greek AMYGDALA.</li>
<li>‘Frenzy’ was originally PHREN-itis.</li>
<li>‘Gillyflower’ was originally KARYO-PHYLL-on, or ‘nut-leaf’</li>
