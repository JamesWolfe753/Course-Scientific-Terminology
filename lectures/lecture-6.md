# Final Exam

## Date and Location

- Wednesday, 20 August 2014
- 9 am to 11 am (2 hours)
- IB 110

## Content

- The exam is cumulative, and drawing on material from both the Greek and Latin portions of the course.

# Evolving Meanings

## Change and Decay

- Meaning is not static or straightforward.  As we have seen, one word does not always mean the same thing every time it is used.
- Just like meanings can vary from one occurrence of a word to another, they can vary over time.

## Metaphor
- META-PHOR is a transfer of meaning.
- Thus ‘gland’ comes from the Latin word for ‘acorn’, but structures that were thought to look like acorns took that name as well, owing to the resemblance.

## Mythology
- Many English words, both in technical and non-technical language, take their name from Classical Mythology.
- Thus we have ‘aphrodisiac’ from Aphrodite, ‘narcissism’ from Narcissus, and the ‘Achilles tendon’ from the hero of the *Iliad*.

## The History of Science
- Science itself is not static. Not only are new discoveries made all the time, but old theories and, indeed, entire paradigms are sometimes overthrown.
- Many words are left behind by discarded theories. Thus we have ‘sanguine’ and ‘melancholic’ from the theory of the four humours.
- Similarly, ‘disaster’, ‘lunacy’ and ‘jovial’ can all be traced to the belief in astrology.

## Linguistic change
- Not only can the meanings of words change substantially, but so can their forms. Not all words with a Greek or Latin origin were deliberately coined by scholars; some of them just evolved over time, and with this comes change.
    - Thus ‘date’ (the fruit, that is) comes from the Greek DACTYL.
    - ‘Almond’ actually comes from the Greek AMYGDALA.
    - ‘Frenzy’ was originally PHREN-itis.
    - ‘Gillyflower’ was originally KARYO-PHYLL-on, or ‘nut-leaf’
