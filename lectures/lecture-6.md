# Final Exam

## Date and Location

- [TFC Cafeteria](http://map.utoronto.ca/utm/marker/tfc_utm) (Davis Building)

## Content

- The exam is cumulative, drawing on material from both the Greek and Latin portions of the course.

# Evolving Meanings

## Change and Decay

- Meaning is not static or straightforward.  As we have seen, one word does not always mean the same thing every time it is used.
- Just like meanings can vary from one occurrence of a word to another, they can vary over time.

## Metaphor
- META-PHOR (Greek μεταϕορά) is a transfer of meaning.
- Thus ‘gland’ comes from the Latin word for ‘acorn’, but structures that were thought to look like acorns took that name as well, owing to the resemblance.

## Mythology
- Many English words, both in technical and non-technical language, take their name from Classical Mythology.
- Thus we have ‘aphrodisiac’ from Aphrodite, ‘narcissism’ from Narcissus, and the ‘Achilles tendon’ from the hero of the *Iliad*.

## The History of Science
- Science itself is not static. Not only are new discoveries made all the time, but old theories and, indeed, entire paradigms are sometimes overthrown.
- Many words are left behind by discarded theories. Thus we have ‘sanguine’ and ‘melancholic’ from the theory of the four humours.
- Similarly, ‘disaster’, ‘lunacy’ and ‘jovial’ can all be traced to the belief in astrology.

## Linguistic change
- Not only can the meanings of words change substantially, but so can their forms. Not all words with a Greek or Latin origin were deliberately coined by scholars; some of them just evolved over time, and with this comes change.
    - Thus ‘date’ (the fruit, that is) comes from the Greek DACTYL.
    - ‘Almond’ actually comes from the Greek AMYGDALA.
    - ‘Frenzy’ was originally PHREN-itis.
    - ‘Gillyflower’ was originally KARYO-PHYLL-on, or ‘nut-leaf’

# Specialization of Meaning

## disease

- Originally referred to any lack of ease.
- Now a discomfort caused by illness.

## physics

- originally 'the study of the natural universe'
- now 'the branch of science concerned with the nature and properties of matter and energy'

## radish

- originally 'root' (Latin *radix, radic-*)
- now 'a swollen pungent-tasting edible root, especially a variety which is small, spherical, and red, and eaten raw with salad'

## insanity

- originally 'lack of health' (Latin *insanus,* from *in-* ‘not’ + *sanus* ‘healthy’)
- now 'the state of being seriously mentally ill'

## grand mal

- in French, simply means 'great sickness’
- used specifically to mean 'a serious form of epilepsy with muscle spasms and prolonged loss of consciousness'

# Generalization of Meaning

## excruciating

- originally referred to literal torture on a cross (Latin *crux, cruc-* ‘a cross’)
- now 'intensely painful' or even 'very embarrassing, awkward, or tedious'

## eradicate

- originally 'to tear up by the roots’
- now 'destroy completely; put an end to'

## crescent

- originally referred to the moon; from Latin *crescere,* ‘grow’
- can now refer to anything shaped like the new moon

# Diseases Named from Symptoms

## hydrophobia

- rabies, especially in humans
- Technically, however, the word only describes a symptom: an extreme or irrational fear of water.

## diabetes

- lit. 'syphon'; from Greek dia- ‘through’ + BA- 'to go'
- The Greek physician Aretaeus of Cappadocia seems to have coined the term διαβήτης (from διαβαίνειν, to pass through), referring to the urinary discharge that accompanies the disease.

- from Greek διϕθέρα ‘skin, hide’

## cirrhosis

- a chronic disease of the liver marked by degeneration of cells, inflammation, and fibrous thickening of tissue
- from Greek κιρρός ‘tawny’ (because this is the colour of the liver in many cases)

## myxoedema

- Greek MYX- 'mucus' + OEDEMA- 'swelling'

## hemorrhoid

- a swollen vein or group of veins in the region of the anus
- from Greek αἱμορροΐδες ‘bleeding' (i.e. of the veins, ϕλέβες), from HAEM- ‘blood’ + an element related to -RRH ‘to flow’.

## shingles

- from Latin *cingulum* ‘girdle’ (*cingere* ‘gird’)

## leprosy

- a contagious disease that affects the skin, mucous membranes, and nerves, causing discolouration and lumps on the skin and, in severe cases, disfigurement and deformities
- from Latin *lepra* ‘scaly’

# Words You Might Not Recognize

## date

- the fruit is from Greek DACTYL- ‘finger’ (because of the finger-like shape of its leaves)
