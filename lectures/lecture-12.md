# Final Exam

## Wednesday, 17 Dec.

- Cumulative: all Greek and Latin vocabulary is fair game, weighted equally.
- Will also include Greek transliteration (i.e. rewriting words in the Greek alphabet into Roman characters, as in the first test).

## Structure

- Six sections.
- Out of a total 250 marks.

## I. Analyse

- Historical and grammatical questions based on the lectures and readings: multiple choice.
- 10 marks

## II. Transliterate

- Rewrite the Greek words using the Roman alphabet.
- Example: ἕλιξ
    - Answer: *helix*.
- 21 marks

## III. Define

- Provide a definition for Greek and Latin stems.
- Example: TELE- (answer: *afar*)
- 50 Greek; 50 Latin
- 100 marks

## IV. Read

- Identify ten words from Latin or Greek in a following passage, breaking them down into their constituent parts and providing the definition of each stem.
- Example answer: *at/tent/ion/al: ‘to’ + ‘to hold’ + ‘state of’ + ‘pertaining to’*.
- 20 marks

## V. Dissect

- Analyse the following words, dividing each word into its Latin and Greek elements and giving the meaning of each
- Example: popular (2 marks).
    - Answer: *popul/ar: 'people' + 'having the character of'*.
- 58 marks

## VI. Translate

- Form a complete English word from the Latin or Greek roots corresponding to the definitions provided.
- Example: ‘before’, ‘in front of’ + ‘back’ + ‘pertaining to’, ‘like’, ‘belonging to’, ‘having the character of’ (Latin, 3 marks)

# The Third Declension

## Case Review

- Nominative case: used to indicate the *subject* of a sentence.
- Accusative case: used to indicate the *object* of a sentence.
- Genitive case: used to indicate possession or close association.

## Odd Things in the Third Declension

- Often a significant difference between the nominative singular and the root that we end up with in English.
- Ending for the nominative singular is inconsistent.
- Often impossible to guess the gender by looking at the ending of the word.

# Back to the Greeks

## The Sanctuary at Epidaurus

- This was a major Greek temple where people went for healing.
- See [Who were the Greeks?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XU5TJoiJ0w#t=22m7s), ep. 1, 22m7s.
- What is familiar about the practices here? How does the mindset here differ from that of a modern hospital?
- Are the approaches here effective methods of informing patients about the
- Medical knowlege aside, where would you rather be treated?

## Romans to the Early Modern Period

## Today

- Marečková et al. (2002) demonstrate that Latin is still a primary means of commmunication: they examine anatomical nomenclature, terms in clinical medicine, and pharmaceutical terminology.
- Notes the attitude that it doesn't necessarily matter (and might even be preferable) if the patient does not know what the term means.
    - Pliny the Elder: the Roman people 'believe less what regards their own health, if they understand'
- Outlines the development of the *Terminologia Anatomica* (International Anatomical Terminology).

- The Greeks and Romans got quite a ways by thinking about a subject, rationalizing it, as opposed to observation.
- What questions are we asking now that might be pointing us in the right direction but might be based on our past, and that we have no way of proving?
