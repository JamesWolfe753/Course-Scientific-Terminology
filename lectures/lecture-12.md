# Final Exam

## Wednesday, 17 Dec.

- Cumulative: all Greek and Latin vocabulary is fair game, weighted equally.
- Will also include Greek transliteration (i.e. rewriting words in the Greek alphabet into Roman characters, as in the first test).

## Structure

1. Analyse (multiple choice): 5 marks
2. Transliterate (Greek to Roman alphabet): 10 marks
3. Define (definitions of Greek/Latin stems)
    a. Greek: 50 marks
    b. Latin: 50 Marks
4. Dissect (breaking down English words into Greek/Latin stems and providing defintitions): 58 marks
5. Read (pick Latin/Greek words out of an article, break them down, and give definitions for stems): 20 marks
6. Translate (construct an English word out of definitions of stems): 22 marks

# The Third Declension (redux)

## Case Review

- Nominative case: used to indicate the *subject* of a sentence.
- Accusative case: used to indicate the *object* of a sentence.
- Genitive case: used to indicate possession or close association.

## Odd Things in the Third Declension

- Often a significant difference between the nominative singular and the root that we end up with in English.
- Ending for the nominative singular is inconsistent.
- Often impossible to guess the gender by looking at the ending of the word.

## Marečková et al. (2002)

- Demonstrate that Latin is still a primary means of commmunication: they examine anatomical nomenclature, terms in clinical medicine, and pharmaceutical terminology.
- Notes the attitude that it doesn't necessarily matter (and might even be preferable) if the patient does not know what the term means.
    - Pliny the Elder: the Roman people 'believe less what regards their own health, if they understand'
- Outlines the development of the *Terminologia Anatomica* (International Anatomical Terminology).
