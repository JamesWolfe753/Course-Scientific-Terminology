# The Third Declension (redux)

## Case Review

- Nominative case: used to indicate the *subject* of a sentence.
- Accusative case: used to indicate the *object* of a sentence.
- Genitive case: used to indicate possession or close association.

## Odd Things in the Third Declension

- Often a significant difference between the nominative singular and the root that we end up with in English.
- Ending for the nominative singular is inconsistent.
- Often impossible to guess the gender by looking at the ending of the word.
