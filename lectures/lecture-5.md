# Last Time

## Greek suffixes

- Diminutive suffixes make things smaller (sometimes used metaphorically): discussed by Dirckx (1999).
- Verb-forming suffixes (you only need to learn two) make a root into a word used to describe an action, state, or occurrence.

## Greek plurals

- There are many ways of making a word plural other than adding an *s*, but fortunately there are only a few set patterns to recall.

## Ancient Interpretations of Plagues

- Ancient authors had a tendency to base their descriptions one another, so one needs to be aware of the historical context when reading these rather than taking their statements at face value.
- Various examples provided by by Dirckx (2000a; 2000b).

# Anatomical Terminology

## Overviews

- [Sakai (2007)](http://dx.doi.org.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/10.1111/j.1447-073X.2007.00180.x), a summary of development from ancient times to the present day
- [Kachlík et al. (2008)](http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00276-008-0357-y): discussion of modern attempts to standardize nomenclature.
- [Dirckx (2006)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B0-08-044854-2/04268-1): summary of premodern influences. (*assigned later in the term*)

## Stages of Development (Sakai)

1. Classical and medieval discussions of anatomy.
2. Vesalius (16th century).
3. Later 16th century: development of more specific anatomical terms (Sylvius in Paris and Bauhin in Basel).
4. 17th century, gradually improved Latin anatomical textbooks; in modern languages in 18th and 19th centuries. Different names used for the same thing by many authors.
5. End of the 19th century: *Nomina anatomica*, the first internationally recognized code of anatomical terminology. Revised on many occasions: today's equivalent is the *Terminologia anatomica*.

## *Terminologia Anatomica*

- The standard reference work for anatomical terminology, in Latin and English.
- Completed in 1998 by the Federative Committee on Anatomical Terminology.
- Some naturally feel that it is incomplete, as for example argued by [Matusz (2010)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ase.133); [Gest, Burkel, and Cortright (2009)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ase.90).
- Not always followed consistently, especially in North America: see [Martin et al. (2014)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/950898).

# Unusual Usage

## Terms from Classical Mythology

- Scientists in the past were often historians, theologians, or literary scholars as well as students of the natural scientists, so naturally they have things names after things they recognized.
- For more, see [Karenberg (2012–13)](http://www.anatomy.org.tr/issue/201301/pdf/05.pdf).

## ammonia

- In mythology
    - Ἄμμων: Amun was a supreme god of the ancient Egyptians, identified with the sun god Ra, and in Greek and Roman times with Zeus and Jupiter (under the name Ammon).
- In science
    - a colourless gas with a characteristic pungent smell, which dissolves in water to give a strongly alkaline solution
- Why? The *OED* suggests: 'The corruption to *armoniac* found in medieval Latin, French, and English, was perhaps due to an association with the Greek ἁρμονία fastening or joining, from the use of gum ammoniac as a cement, or of sal ammoniac in the joining of metals.'

## Achilles tendon

- In mythology
    - Achilles was a hero of the Trojan War, son of Peleus and Thetis. During his infancy his mother plunged him in the Styx, thus making his body invulnerable except for the heel by which she held him.
    - During the Trojan War Achilles killed Hector but was later wounded in the heel by an arrow shot by Paris and died.
- In science
    - the tendon connecting calf muscles to the heel.
- Achilles heel: a weakness or vulnerable point. Said to have been so named by Philip Verheyen, but this may be apocryphal.

## Words and the History of Science

- The *humours* (Latin, *humor*) were originally bodily fluids: this sense survives in 'aqueous humour' and 'vitreous humour', and were thought to affect one's mood.
    - Four humours: blood, phlehm, yellow bile (*chole*), black bile (*melan chole*).
    - Thus the terms 'choleric', 'melancholy' (literally an excess of black bile).
- This is how the practice of bloodletting seemed to make sense. (See [BBC *Blood and Guts*, ep. 5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErpMhBiVyrc#t=1m35s), starting about 1m35s.)

---

- *Disaster* literally means 'ill-starred'.
- A *lunatic* was so called because it was thought that the moon caused temporary insanity.
- The term *jovial* apparently comes from a supposition that those born under the planet Jupiter were good-tempered because of its influence.
