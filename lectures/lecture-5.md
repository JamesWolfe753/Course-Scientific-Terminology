# Anatomical Terminology

## Articles

- [Dirckx (2006)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/B0-08-044854-2/04268-1): summary of premodern influences.
- [Kachlík et al. (2008)](http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00276-008-0357-y): discussion of modern attempts to standarize nomenclature.

## Words and the History of Science

- The *humours* (Latin, *humor*) were originally bodily fluids: this sense survives in 'aqueous humour' and 'vitreous humour', and were thought to affect one's mood.
    - Four humours: blood, phlehm, yellow bile (*chole*), black bile (*melan chole*).
    - Thus the terms 'choleric', 'melancholy' (literally an excess of black bile).

---

- *Disaster* literally means 'ill-starred'.
- A *lunatic* was so called because it was thought that the moon caused temporary insanity.
- The term *jovial* apparently comes from a supposition that those born under the planet Jupiter were good-tempered because of its influence.
