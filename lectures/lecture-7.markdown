# SALVETE!

## Welcome to a new language: Latin!

- Latin is the language of ancient Latium, now Lazio, the region around Rome.
- With the expansion of Roman power, Latin was spoken in various forms across Europe. Very often it developed into what are now known as the Romance Languages.

---

- Classical Latin, even more than Classical Greek, was for many centuries a central part of the education of European elites. As a consequence, its contribution to scientific language has been immense.

---

- We will learn Latin bases, suffixes and prefixes in just the way in which we learned those coming from Greek.
- We will also, however, learn real Latin nouns and adjectives, since sometimes these occur on their own in scientific writing.

---

- Latin bases sometimes occur in English on their own, with or without an extra final *-e*:
    - FORT-, ‘strong’ – fort
    - VERB-, ‘word’ – verb
    - GRAV-, ‘heavy’ – grave
- More often, bases are combined with prefixes and suffixes:
    - in-, ‘on’ + GRAV-, ‘heavy’ + esc-, ‘to become’ + -ent, ‘-ing’ = ingravescent
    - FIN-, ‘end’ + -al, ‘pertaining to’ + -ity, ‘state of’ = finality

---

- Connecting vowels in Latin are most often *i* or *o*, but other vowels can be used:
    - SACR-, ‘sacred’ + i + FIC-, ‘to make’ + -e = sacrifice
    - SACR- + o + SANCT-, ‘sacred’ = sacrosanct
- Greek and Latin prefixes, suffixes and bases sometimes combine, but not nearly as often as they combine within each group:
    - AUTO- (Gr. ‘self’) + MOB- (Lat. ‘to move’ + -ile = automobile
    - hyper- (Gr. ‘over’) + TENS (Lat. ‘to stretch’) + ion = hypertension

## Phonetic Change
- Often when a prefix is added to a base that starts with a consonant, the last consonant of the prefix is ‘assimilated’ to the first consonant of the base.
    - ex-, ‘from’ + FECT-, ‘to make’ = effect
    - in-, ‘not’ + LEG-, ‘to read’ + -ible = illegible
    - ob-, ‘against’ + FEND-, ‘to hit’ = offend
    - sub-, ‘under’ + FER-, ‘to bear’ = suffer

---

- A final *n* in a prefix will become *m* before a *p* or a *b*.
    - in-, ‘not’ + POSS, ‘to be able’ + -ible = impossible
    - con-, ‘with’ + PLET + e = complete
- Sometimes the base itself will change when a prefix is added. You will learn these variant forms as you learn bases.
    - FACT- gives ‘factory’ and ‘manufacture’, but also ‘effect’ and ‘defect’
    - SED- gives ‘sedentary’, but also ‘reside’

# Hybrid Words

## Dirckx (1977)

- Some scientists have periodically raised the opinion that words combining multiple languages should not exist.
- In fact, Latin borrowed from Greek even in classical times.
- Much of our medical terminology originates with writings attributed to Hippocrates (of the Hippocratic Oath; ca. 460–ca. 370 BC).
- Celsus (first century AD) is a major source for early Roman usage of medical terminology.

---

- Thus, Latin suffixes have often used on Greek roots, especially since the Middle Ages:
    - e.g. *pterygion* and *teinesmos* became *pterygium* and *tenesmus*
    - Greek adjectival endings took on Latin form: *kardiakos* becoming *cardiacus*
    - Latin adjectival suffixes began to be appended to Greek nouns, as in *arterialis*, from *arteria*.

---

- Conversely, Greek suffixes such as *-itis*, *-osis*, and *-otomía* have been used with Latin roots:
    - conjunctivitis
    - granuloma
    - tuberculosis
- Greek prefixes were also attached to Latin stems (epidural, pararectal) and Latin prefixes to Greek stems (subdiaphragmatic, retropharyngeal).

---

- The combination of Greek and Latin stems in a single word did not nonetheless become common until the nineteenth century; there is still some debate over this.
- Thus, we have both phlebography (pure Greek) and venography (Latin/Greek).
