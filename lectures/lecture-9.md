# Your Next Test 

## What is included?

- All vocabulary (cumulative) up to and including lecture 10; the focus will be on Latin.
- Basic questions on articles for lectures 6 through 10 (this is not cumulative).
- There will be a question asking you to take words from a paragraph of a scientific article; it will follow the format of today's practice quiz.

# X-ray Synchrotron Microtomography of a silicified Jurassic Cheirolepidiaceae (Conifer) cone

---

- Look over the passage on the page: identify ten words of Greek or Latin origin and provide their roots.

---

We **document** a new **species** of **ovulate** **cone** (***Pararaucaria*** *collinsonae*) on the **basis** of **silicified fossils** from the Late Jurassic Purbeck Limestone Group of southern **England** (Tithonian Stage: ca. 145 million years). Our **description** **principally** **relies** on the **anatomy** of the **ovuliferous** **scales**, revealed through **X-ray** **synchrotron** **microtomography** (SRXMT) **performed** at the **Diamond Light Source** (UK).

---

This **study** **represents** the first **application** of SRXMT to **macro-scale** **silicified** **plant** **fossils**, and **demonstrates** the **significant** **advantages** of this **approach**, which can **resolve** **cellular** **structure** over **lab-based** **X-ray** **computed** **microtomography** (XMT). 

---

The **method** enabled us to **characterize** **tissues** and **precisely** demarcate their **boundaries**, **elucidating** **organ** shape, and thus **allowing** an **accurate** **assessment** of **affinities**. The **cones** are broadly **spherical** (**ca.** 1.3 **cm** **diameter**), and are structured around a central axis with helically arranged bract/scale complexes, each of which bares a single ovule.

# Suffixes II

# Early-Modern Scientists and Terminology

---

> I learn more from the anatomy of an ant or a blade of grass … than from all the books which have been written since the beginning of time. This is so, since I have begun … to read the book of God … the model according to which I correct the human books which have been copied badly and arbitrarily and without attention to the things that are written in the original book of the Universe.

(Tommaso Campanella, quoted in Eisenstein 2005, 218)

---

> Philosophy is written in this grand book, the universe which stands continually open to our gaze. But the book cannot be understood unless one first learns to comprehend the language and read the letters in which it is composed. It is written in the language of mathematics.

(Galileo, quoted in Eisenstein 2005, 265)

## Why did printing matter?

- Books today might seem as if they restrict science, but the opposite is true if one takes a long view of history.
- Elizabeth Eisenstein of the first scholars to make a thorough argument for the printing press as an actual means of change in a book published in 1979; it is a somewhat controversial book, but very influential.
- The chapter from her 2005 book on the optional reading list is condensed from her 1979 work; most of the material from today's lecture is reacting to it.

## A case study: Vesalius

- Andries van Wesel, 31 December 1514–15 October 1564
- The Fisher library owns a copy of Vesalius's *De humani corporis fabrica* (first published 1543) with annotations from the author himself.
- In general, see Ivanová and Holomáňová (2001); Musil et al. (2014) discuss his contributions to the naming of the skelatal muscles.
