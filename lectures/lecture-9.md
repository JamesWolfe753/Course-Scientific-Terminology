## Prefixes

> **Di**cynodonts are an **ex**clusively herbivorous clade of synapsids.

---

They **com**prise more than 100 species that are known from the Middle Permian the Late Triassic periods Dicynodonts were morphologically **dis**parate and **pre**sented a wide range of sizes and putative ecological niches, **in**cluding semi-aquatic, fossorial, arboreal and grazing.

---

**De**spite over 150 years of **di**cynodont research, several paleobiological aspects of the neuroanatomy, inner ear morphology and **inter**nal cranium anatomy remain practically **ob**scure.

---

Moreover, because the **de**structive technique of serial sampling was the primary way to access the **inter**nal anatomy of **di**cynodont skulls, the data available for various taxa was **in**consistent and rarely subjected to synthetic treatments. 

---

As a **re**sult, details of **inter**nal skull anatomy have been overlooked in **re**cent phylogenetic analyses. Only Surkov and Benton **in**cluded a large number of braincase characters in a phylogenetic analysis of **di**cynodonts.

---

**Re**cent **ad**vances in non-destructive imaging techniques such as high resolution **com**puted tomography, neutron tomography, and synchrotron radiation based micro-computed tomography, hold the potential to **pro**vide significant new **in**sight **in**to fossil skull morphology. However, the **ap**plication of such techniques to **di**cynodonts has been limited.

## Wood Roots

The sheep used in these **experiments** were cared as per outlined in the Guide for the Care and **Use** of **Animals** in **Agricultural** Research and Teaching **Consortium** [8]. Thirty **affected** and 30 **unaffected** sheep were slaughtered with **electrical** stunning then **exsanguination** ....

---

The **study** **area** was located in a region **adjoined** by the **provinces** of Guizhou, Yunnan, and Sichuan (26°56'-27°47' N, 103°56'-104°51' E), with the average **elevation** 2100 m above the sea **level**, the **annual** **precipitation** 956 mm, and the average **atmospheric temperature** 9–11°C.

---

The **main** grassland **species** **include** Puccinellia (*Chinam **poensis** ohuji*), Siberian **Nitraria** (***Nitraria*** sibirica ***pall***), **Floriated astragalus** (***Astragalus floridus***), **Poly-branched astragals** (*A.* ***polycladus***), **Falcate** whin (***Oxytropis falcate***), Ewenki **automomous** banner (***Elymus nutans***), **Common leymus** (***Leymus secalinus***), and June grass (***Koeleria cristata***).
