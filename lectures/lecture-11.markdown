## # Declensions
- Inflection is the changing of a word’s form to reflect its grammatical role in a sentence.
- Like Greek, Latin is a highly inflected language. The form of a word can vary based on gender, number and case (nouns and adjectives) or on person, number, tense and mood (verbs).
- We will learn how how to decline some Latin nouns and adjectives in two out of six cases.

---

- The nominative case is used for the subject of a sentence. This is the a word’s dictionary form.
- The genitive case is used for a word that depends on another. It can usually be translated using the word ‘of’.
- Each case also has singular and plural forms. For example:
    - lingua (nom. sing.) = ‘tongue’
    - linguae (nom. plur.) = ‘tongues’
    - linguae (gen. sing.) = ‘of the tongues’
    - linguarum (gen. plur.) = ‘of the tongues’

---

- In Latin, nouns are masculine, feminine or neuter. For our purposes, you can always infer the gender of a noun from its ending (though in fact real Latin is not so regular).
- The first declension is made up of words ending in ‘-a’, which are nearly always feminine.
- The second declension is made up of words ending in ‘-us’, which are nearly always masculine, and words ending in ‘-um’, which are neuter.

## The first declension

## The second declension

- Thus *arcus costarum* is ‘arch of the ribs’ and *venae oculi* is ‘the veins of the eye’
- NB: Latin has neither the definite (‘the’) nor the indefinite (‘a/an’) article. Therefore vena may be translated as ‘vein’, ‘a vein’ or ‘the vein’, whichever seems appropriate.
- Latin adjectives must agree in gender (masculine, feminine or neuter), number (plural or singular) and case with the adjectives they modify. In real Latin, adjectives can be placed almost anywhere in a sentence, but in scientific expressions they usually follow the noun the modify.
- The adjectives you will see belong to a group that takes the endings of the first or the second declension, as longus, -a, -um
- Thus we could have *nervus longus, lingua longa,* or *labium longum.*
