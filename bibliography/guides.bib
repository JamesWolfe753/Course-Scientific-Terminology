It presents Latin before Greek, which seems to be a disadvantage, since this has prompted some students to think that Greek words originate in Latin. It has been used as a textbook at the University of Toronto as recently as 2014, but only with extensive adaptation.},

	abstract = {Chemical nomenclature can be a complicated subject. As a result, most works on the subject are rather dry textbooks and primarily consist of sets of instructions on how to name chemicals. This practical book proves that chemical nomenclature can be interesting, not just a 'necessary evil'. Written in a lively and engaging style by experts in their particular fields, this new book provides a general discussion on why good, clear nomenclature is needed. It introduces the reader to the various forms of nomenclature without reading like a textbook. Both 'systematic' and 'trivial' nomenclature systems are used widely (and interchangeably) in chemistry and this new book covers both areas. For example, systematic nomenclature in both the {CAS} and {IUPAC} styles is introduced. These systems have many similarities but important differences which the chemist should be aware of. Specialized naming systems are needed for polymers and natural products and these areas are covered in separate chapters. The naming of elements is a very topical subject at the moment and so this is included to ensure a comprehensive coverage. Covering a wide range of topics in the area of nomenclature and acting as an introduction to a varied field, this book will be of interest to industrial chemists as well as students at senior undergraduate and postgraduate level.},
