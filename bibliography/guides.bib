The content of this guide to health vocabulary introduces students to Latin and English word derivations and to the sources of medical terminology in classical mythology. The introductory material provides general notes on the teaching of Latin in the Philadelphia School District, suggestions for scheduling and staffing the Latin classes, an outline of the organization of each lesson, some general hints to the teacher, and an overview of the material to be taught in this unit. The material to be taught is presented in 11 lessons, a number of word games, and a unit review lesson. An annotated bibiliography completes the unit. ({AMH})},
