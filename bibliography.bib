  abstract = {Chemical nomenclature can be a complicated subject. As a result, most works on the subject are rather dry textbooks and primarily consist of sets of instructions on how to name chemicals. This practical book proves that chemical nomenclature can be interesting, not just a 'necessary evil'. Written in a lively and engaging style by experts in their particular fields, this new book provides a general discussion on why good, clear nomenclature is needed. It introduces the reader to the various forms of nomenclature without reading like a textbook. Both 'systematic' and 'trivial' nomenclature systems are used widely (and interchangeably) in chemistry and this new book covers both areas. For example, systematic nomenclature in both the CAS and IUPAC styles is introduced. These systems have many similarities but important differences which the chemist should be aware of. Specialized naming systems are needed for polymers and natural products and these areas are covered in separate chapters. The naming of elements is a very topical subject at the moment and so this is included to ensure a comprehensive coverage. Covering a wide range of topics in the area of nomenclature and acting as an introduction to a varied field, this book will be of interest to industrial chemists as well as students at senior undergraduate and postgraduate level.},

@article{lydiatt:2010historical,
  abstract = {The etymological evolution of the anatomical terms larynx, cricoid, glottis, epiglottis, and thyroid (cartilage) dates to antiquity. Human dissection replaced animal in the 16th and 17th centuries and terms evolved. This evolution was recorded in the literature largely in Latin. We translated key studies of laryngeal anatomy from the 16th century to better understand this evolution. We present the Latin with our translations, and historical commentary as essential to this understanding. Vesalius favored the Latin scutiform (shield) for the thyroid cartilage, but recognized peltalis (shield). The Basle Nomina Anatomica (BNA) chose the Greek thyroid (theta upsilon rho epsilon omicron epsilon iota delta eta) for modern convention. Vesalius used the name "innominate" for the cricoid cartilage, but described its resemblance to a ring, drawn in the margin of the Fabrica. Krikoid, the Greek for ring shaped, was adopted by the BNA. Although the term arytenoid was used for centuries, Vesalius argued the Greek name referred to the spout of a cup or ladle. He recognized the human arytenoids as two separate cartilages as opposed to single in certain animals. The glottis was defined by Vesalius as the vocal fold or rima glottidis of today, and he advanced its function by understanding the paired, mobile arytenoid cartilages. He defined the function of the epiglottis and first described the pre-epiglottic space. Vesalius' student at Padua, Italy, Columbo contributed to anatomical knowledge, but animosity between them clouded the record. Harvey, working 75 years later in England, offers an evolutionary window from Vesalius. Harvey's laryngeal studies preceded by a decade his groundbreaking studies on the circulation of blood.},

@article{gal:2011stereochemical,
  abstract = {Asymmetric objects are necessarily chiral, but a structure may be chiral and not asymmetric if it possesses one or more proper rotation axes. Chiral but not asymmetric molecules are important in chemistry and its applications, but no suitable term exists for the designation of such structures, and their terminology in the literature is confused and chaotic. Dissymmetric has been redefined by some authors as "chiral but not asymmetric," in conflict both with Pasteur's definition of the term as "not superposable on its mirror image" (without other restrictions, i.e., chiral) and the understanding of the term in stereochemistry. Moreover, dissymmetric and asymmetric are frequently confused because of their similar forms. Furthermore, dissymmetric is widely used in many other definitions in chemistry, physics, and other disciplines. Thus, dissymmetric is unsuitable in the new definition of "chiral but not asymmetric," and a new term is needed. The adjective "symmanumorphous" is therefore proposed for "chiral but not asymmetric". "Sym" (from symmetry) indicates the presence of some symmetry in the structure, and "manu" (from "manus," Latin for hand, e.g., manual, manuscript) refers to its handedness. "Morphous," from the Greek "morphē," that is, form, is widely used, for example, anthropomorphous, enantiomorphous, etc. Symmanumorphous is convenient and euphonious and at 15 characters (same as enantiomorphous) is not unduly long. The nouns "a symmanumorph" (a structure that is chiral but not asymmetric) and "symmanumorphism" (the phenomenon of chirality without asymmetry) are also proposed. The new terminology is adaptable in other languages and would contribute to creating order out of linguistic chaos.},

@article{bezas:2012greek,
  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The Greek language, the root of most Latin anatomical terms, is deeply present in the Anatomical Terminology. Many studies seek to analyze etymologically the terms stemming from the Greek words. In most of these studies, the terms appear defined according to the etymological understanding of the respective authors at the time of its creation. Therefore, it is possible that the terms currently used are not consistent with its origin in ancient Greek words.
METHODS: We selected cardiologic anatomical terms derived from Greek words, which are included in the International Anatomical Terminology. We performed an etymological analysis using the Greek roots present in the earliest terms. We compared the cardiologic anatomical terms currently used in Greece and Brazil to the Greek roots originating from the ancient Greek language. We used morphological decomposition of Greek roots, prefixes, and suffixes. We also verified their use on the same lexicons and texts from the ancient Greek language.
RESULTS: We provided a list comprising 30 cardiologic anatomical terms that have their origins in ancient Greek as well as their component parts in the International Anatomical Terminology. We included the terms in the way they were standardized in Portuguese, English, and Modern Greek as well as the roots of the ancient Greek words that originated them.
CONCLUSION: Many works deal with the true origin of words (etymology) but most of them neither returns to the earliest roots nor relate them to their use in texts of ancient Greek language. By comparing the world's greatest studies on the etymology of Greek words, this paper tries to clarify the differences between the true origin of the Greek anatomical terms as well as the origins of the cardiologic anatomical terms more accepted today in Brazil by health professionals.},

Nineteenth century scientists examining these plants because of their folkloric reputations discovered their active compounds and documented their physiological effects.

@article{soutis:2006ancient,
  abstract = {It is widely accepted that the medical terminology has its roots in ancient Greek and Latin. Greek words have been used not only in the field of medicine but also in every day language for many centuries. The aim of this article is to provide an abbreviated guide to the etymology and the meaning of Greek words used in the medical literature today, emphasizing on the field of pediatric surgery. Thus, the term paediatric is constructed from the words paedion, meaning “child”, and iatriki, meaning “medicine”, literally, “medicine for children.” Surgery, however, is not a Greek word. The corresponding Greek term is chirourgiki, derived from cheir and ergon, that is, “hand and action,” meaning the action made by hands. This term is also found in the French and German medical literature as chirourgie and chirurgie, respectively. Some general terms in surgery are also of Greek origin. The word trauma has been transferred into the English literature without modification and comes from the verb diatitreno, meaning to “penetrate.” Other such terms include diagnosis, from the verb diagignosko, meaning to “discriminate”; symptom, from the verb sympipto, that is, “to coinside”; and the adjectives clinical and clinic, from the noun klini, meaning “bed.”
Focusing on special fields of pediatric surgery, the etymology and the meaning of Greek words used in the medical literature will be shown and analyzed.},

Because Western science and medicine began in Greece, the earliest names for parts of the body were Greek words, at first borrowed from the vernacular.

Later, as Latin became the international medium of scholarly communication, a copious and richly metaphoric but unsystematic lexicon of anatomy evolved in that language. In the 19th century, European anatomists organized to forge a more logical, consistent, and economical Latin nomenclature.

  abstract = {Previous research focusing on Classical Latin and Greek roots has shown that understanding the etymology of English anatomical terms may be beneficial for students of human anatomy. However, not all anatomical terms are derived from Classical origins. This study aims to explore the linguistic roots of the Modern English terminology used in human gross anatomy. By reference to the Oxford English Dictionary, etymologies were determined for a lexicon of 798 Modern English gross anatomical terms from the 40th edition of Gray's Anatomy. Earliest traceable language of origin was determined for all 798 terms; language of acquisition was determined for 747 terms. Earliest traceable languages of origin were: Classical Latin (62\%), Classical Greek (24\%), Old English (7\%), Post-Classical Latin (3\%), and other (4\%). Languages of acquisition were: Classical Latin (42\%), Post-Classical Latin (29\%), Old English (8\%), Modern French (6\%), Classical Greek (5\%), Middle English (3\%), and other (7\%). While the roots of Modern English anatomical terminology mostly lie in Classical languages (accounting for the origin of 86\% of terms), the anatomical lexicon of Modern English is actually much more diverse. Interesting and perhaps less familiar examples from these languages and the methods by which such terms have been created and absorbed are discussed. The author suggests that awareness of anatomical etymologies may enhance the enjoyment and understanding of human anatomy for students and teachers alike. Clin.

@article{paluzzi:2012retracing,
  abstract = {Researching the origin of the terms that we use to identify neuroanatomical structures is a helpful and fascinating exercise. It can provide neuroscientists with a better insight and understanding of the macroscopic anatomy of the cranium and its contents. It can also help the novice to this discipline to become acquainted with structures whose three dimensional anatomy is often difficult to appreciate. The purpose of this article was to investigate the etymology of some of the terms referring to the macroscopic anatomical structures of the skull and the intracranial cavity. We observed how each name unravels an interesting story, sometimes linked to mythological creatures, other times to the shape of animals or objects and tools of everyday life. We conclude that even without a deep knowledge of the Greek, Latin, or Arabic language, learning who described a particular structure and how they decided to name it, makes the study of neuroanatomy more complete and fulfilling.

  abstract = {The giants of medicine and anatomy have each left their mark on the history of the cranial nerves, and much of the history of anatomic study can be viewed through the lens of how the cranial nerves were identified and named. A comprehensive literature review on the classification of the cranial names was performed. The identification of the cranial nerves began with Galen in the 2nd century AD and evolved up through the mid-20th century. In 1778, Samuel Sömmerring, a German anatomist, classified the 12 cranial nerves as we recognize them today. This review expands on the excellent investigations of Flamm, Shaw, and Simon et al., with discussion of the historical identification as well as the process of naming the human cranial nerves. Clin.

Emphasis is laid on Vesalius' effort to unify terms as far as their meaning is concerned, to record lexical items and to create a permanent nomenclature in order to eliminate discrepancies in this field of communication. Our paper contains a lot of information on terminology demonstrating Vesalius' language reform and reminding us of his great achievement, for which he is considered a forerunner of anatomy nomenclature codification.

Its history goes back to 1895, when the first Latin anatomical nomenclature was published as Basiliensia Nomina Anatomica. It was followed by seven revisions (Jenaiensia Nomina Anatomica 1935, Parisiensia Nomina Anatomica 1955, Nomina Anatomica 2nd to 6th edition 1960-1989). The last revision, Terminologia Anatomica, (TA) created by the Federative Committee on Anatomical Terminology and approved by the International Federation of Associations of Anatomists, was published in 1998. Apart from the official Latin anatomical terminology, it includes a list of recommended English equivalents. In this article, major changes and pitfalls of the nomenclature are discussed, as well as the clinical anatomy terms. The last revision (TA) is highly recommended to the attention of not only teachers, students and researchers, but also to clinicians, doctors, translators, editors and publishers to be followed in their activities.},

@article{fabry:2006amplification,
  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Terminologia anatomica is the new standard in anatomical terminology. This terminology is available only in Latin and English and its worldwide adoption is subject to the addition of terms from others languages. On the other hand, Nomina anatomica, the previous standard, has been widely translated. Aim of this work was to append foreign terms to Terminologia by using similarity-matching algorithm between its Latin terms and those from Nomina.
METHODS: A semi-automatic matching of Latin terms from Terminologia with those of Nomina was performed using a string-to-string distance algorithm and manual assessment. We used a French-Latin version of Nomina together with Terminologia and we suggested French terms for Terminologia. Coverage was evaluated by the number of exact and approximate matches. A target of 78\% was set due to the higher number of terms in Terminologia compared to Nomina. Relevance was estimated by manually comparing the meanings of the English and French terms related to the same Latin term. The question was whether they refer to the same anatomical structure.
RESULTS: Exact or approximate matches were found for 5982 terms (76.5\%) of Terminologia. Our results indicated that more than 75\% of the terms from Terminologia came from Nomina, most of them were left unchanged and all were used with the same meaning.
CONCLUSION: This method produces relevant results, reaching our 78\% target. The method is based only on Latin terms and can be used for other languages. We consider this work as a starting point for adding terms to other knowledge sources, such as the foundational model of anatomy or the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS).},

@article{opitz:2013historical,
  abstract = {In their ontogeny and phylogeny all living beings are historical entities. The revolution in biology of the 18th and 19th centuries that did away with the scala naturae according to which we humans, the acme of creation, "made a little lower than the angels," also led to the gradual realization that a humble one-celled protist ("protoctist"), such as Entamoeba histolytica of ill repute {[}Margulis and Chapman, {]} has the same 4-billion-year phylogeny as that of Homo sapiens, vivid testimony to common ancestry and the relatedness of all living beings on earth. The group of medical geneticists who assembled at the NIH, Bethesda, MD this January to address terms pertaining to human ontogeny, did so in the long tradition of Sydenham, Linnaeus, Meckel, Geoffroy St-Hilaire père et fils, Wilhelm His and so many others before who had over the previous two centuries wrestled as earnestly as they could with concepts of "classification" and nomenclature of developmental anomalies. The prior massive need for classification per se in medical morphology has diminished over the years in favor of ever more sophisticated understanding of pathogenesis and cause through experimental biology and genetics; however, in the winter of 2013 it was still found prudent to respect terminological precedent on general terms while recognizing recent advances in developmental pathology requiring clarification and definition of special terms. Efforts along similar lines instigated by the German Society of Anatomists at their first meeting in Leipzig in 1887 culminated, after intense years of work by hundreds of experts and consultants under the goad of Wilhelm His, in the Basel Nomina Anatomica {[}BNA, His (1895){]}. His, himself, stated prefatorily that the BNA had no legislative weight, only an evanescent consensus of many to be amended in the future as needed and indicated. Without hubris, no one before or after will do the same. The more substantial the consensus the more permanent the structure. After some 120 years the BNA is alive and flourishing. Now retitled Terminologia Anatomica, it has been amended and added to many times, is still in Latin but now with synonyms in English, the new lingua franca of science, for every anatomical, histological and embryological term. May our successors be equally effective.},

@article{dirckx:1977hybrid,
  abstract = {SEVERAL communications recently published in the medical literature have stirred up the embers of an ageold controversy about compound words that contain both Greek and Latin elements. Ganias1 proposed the introduction of five new ophthalmologic terms of Greek origin to rectify certain bilingual coinages that he found "complicated and confusing." In a related editorial,2 Blodi approved the effort to "keep the language unadulterated," ie, to avoid coupling Greek with Latin.Hussey3 took up the question of hybrid terms and dealt with it in a reasonable and practical fashion. After contributing his own balanced views, he presented the results of a small poll of other editors' opinions: all agreed that opposition to Greek-Latin hybrids is, in general, both groundless and futile. My purpose is to place the question in historical perspective and to offer practical suggestions for its resolution.THE DEVELOPMENT OF TECHNICAL NOMENCLATURE

@article{mareckova:2002latin,
  abstract = {The present paper offers an up-to-date view of the status of Latin as the language of medicine, namely in its terminological component. It is concerned in greater detail with the three basic terminological vocabularies in which a doctor cannot so far manage without its knowledge. In this sense a primary rank is occupied by anatomical nomenclature whose international version remains Latin in the full extent. A more varied picture is presented by the clinical disciplines where, apart from Latin terms, expressions of ancient provenance have been applied in a large measure in the form of ethnic languages. At the same time, particularly in view of the needs of computerisation, repeated attempts have appeared to support English, which has the greatest chance of becoming a new language in the particular region of clinical medicine. In pharmaceutical terminology Latin has, for the time being, remained a functioning means of international communication, guaranteed by the European Pharmacopoeia (1996) and by the corpus of International Non-proprietary Names (1992, 1996), even though in the future an ever stronger competition of national languages should be taken into account.},

@article{buchanan:2013austerity,
  abstract = {As necessary austerity measures make major inroads into western health services, this paper investigates the philology of austerity and finds that there are two subtly similar yet importantly different derivations from the Latin and the Greek. The Latin austerus is an abstract term meaning dry, harsh, sour; whereas the Greek austeros has a more embodied and literal meaning of making the tongue dry. What seems an initially subtle difference between the metaphorical and the metonymic plays out as involving seriously different outcomes between harsh economic measures and the literal effects on the people suffering under measures that actually make the tongue dry. The paper argues that between the trope and the literal that which Wittgenstein described as ‘a language game’ ensues wherein the metaphorical through a sleight of grammar is passed off as being real while, the literal effects on real people is downplayed as metaphorical ‘collateral damage’. The paper further argues that within this grammar that forces itself upon us, the game of capital is played out through what the author terms an austerity bargain that is levelled by the financial elites: healthy capitalism equals a healthy society. The paper then examines the six elements of the social determinants of health and what actually contributes to a healthy society. Rather than being under an individual threat of exclusion from what Marx termed a superabundance, the paper considers the irreducible differences between the game of capital's individualism, and, the social determinants of health's social inclusion, legitimization and that which Habermas termed public authentication. The paper concludes that not only do necessary austerity measures need to be critiqued but that they radically undermine what determines a healthy society. It follows also that the social determinants of health, radically undermine the bargain inherent for the privileged few within the game of capital.},

It is emphasized that there is a broad influence of ancient Greek and Latin terms, the basic source of much of our medical terminology. As for the motivation, terms are divided into three groups: the terms with direct, indirect and neutral motivation. The groups show different portions of motivation in the formation of the terms. The result of the analysis is the discovery that in the six compared languages, there are applied the same motivation elements, which are expressed by means of the same language elements.

@article{musil:2014history,
  abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of this literary search was to chart the etymology of 32 selected human skeletal muscles, representative of all body regions.
METHODS: In researching this study, analysis of 15 influential Latin and German anatomical textbooks, dating from the sixteenth to the nineteenth century, was undertaken, as well as reference to four versions of the official Latin anatomical terminologies. Particular emphasis has been placed on the historical development of muscular nomenclature, and the subsequent division of these data into groups, defined by similarities in the evolution of their names into the modern form.
RESULTS: The first group represents examples of muscles whose names have not changed since their introduction by Vesalius (1543). The second group comprises muscles which earned their definitive names during the seventeenth and eighteenth century. The third group is defined by acceptance into common anatomical vernacular by the late nineteenth century, including those outlined in the first official Latin terminology (B.N.A.) of 1895. The final group is reserved for six extra-ocular muscles with a particularly poetic history, favoured and popularised by the anatomical giants of late Renaissance and 1,700 s.
CONCLUSIONS: As this study will demonstrate, it is evident that up until introduction of the B.N.A. there was an extremely liberal approach to naming muscles, deserving great respect in the retrospective terminological studies if complete and relevant results are to be achieved. Without this knowledge of the vernacular of the ages past, modern researchers can find themselves 'reinventing the wheel' in looking for their answers.},

@article{whitmore:1999terminologia,
  abstract = {Over many years, anatomical terminology has been the subject of much controversy and disagreement. Previously, the International Anatomical Nomenclature Committee has been responsible for the production of six editions of Nomina Anatomica. In 1989 a new committee, the Federative Committee on Anatomical Terminology (FCAT), was created by its parent body, the International Federation of Associations of Anatomists (IFAA). FCAT has worked for 9 years and published Terminologia Anatomica (TA) in 1998. FCAT's aim has been to democratize the terminology and make it the internationally accepted, living language of anatomy. The worldwide adoption of the same terminology would eliminate national differences, which were causing extreme confusion in instances where the same structure was known by several names. The new terminology is thus the result of worldwide consultation and contains Latin and equivalent English terms. It is indexed in Latin and English and contains an index of eponyms in order to find the correct non-eponymous term. The future goal of FCAT is to continue to improve the terminology—new structures are described, different terms come into use, and the terminology needs to be expanded to include terms used by clinicians for structures that currently do not appear in the list. Future versions of the terminology must accommodate the needs of all who use it, both in the clinical and scientific worlds. Anat. Rec. (New Anat.): 257:50–53, 1999. © 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

@inbook{eisenstein:2005book,
  abstract = {Problems associated with the rise of modern science lend themselves to a similar argument. In other words, I think the advent of printing ought to be featured more prominently by historians of science when they set the stage for the downfall of Ptolemaic astronomy, Galenic anatomy, or Aristotelian physics. This means asking for a somewhat more drastic revision of current guidelines than seems necessary in Reformation studies. In the latter field, the impact of printing may be postponed, but at least it is usually included among the agents that promoted Luther's cause. The outpouring of tracts and cartoons left too vivid and strong an impression for the new medium to be entirely discounted when investigating the Protestant Revolt. The contrary seems true in the case of the so-called scientific revolution. Exploitation of the mass medium was more common among pseudoscientists and quacks than among Latin-writing professional scientists, who often withheld their work from the press. When important treatises did appear in print, they rarely achieved the status of bestsellers. Given the limited circulation of works such as De revolutionibus and the small number of readers able to understand them, it appears plausible to play down the importance of printing. Given the wider circulation of antiquated materials, many authorities are inclined to go even further and assign to early printers a negative, retrogressive role.},

  abstract = {The Papanicolaou Society of Cytopathology has developed a set of guidelines for pancreatobiliary cytology including indications for endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy, techniques of EUS-FNA, terminology and nomenclature of pancreatobiliary disease, ancillary testing, and postbiopsy treatment and management. All documents are based on the expertise of the authors, a review of the literature, discussions of the draft document at several national and international meetings over an 18-month period and synthesis of online comments of the draft document on the Papanicolaou Society of Cytopathology web site (www.papsociety.org). This document selectively presents the results of these discussions and focuses on a proposed standardized terminology scheme for pancreatobiliary specimens that correlate cytological diagnosis with biological behavior and increasingly conservative patient management of surveillance only. The proposed terminology scheme recommends a six-tiered system: Nondiagnostic, Negative, Atypical, Neoplastic (benign or other), Suspicious and Positive. Unique to this scheme is the “Neoplastic” category separated into “benign” (serous cystadenoma), or “Other” (premalignant mucinous cysts, neuroendocrine tumors, and solid-pseudopapillary neoplasms). The positive or malignant category is reserved for high-grade, aggressive malignancies including ductal adenocarcinoma, acinar cell carcinoma, poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas, pancreatoblastoma, lymphoma, and metastases. Interpretation categories do not have to be used. Some pathology laboratory information systems require an interpretation category, which places the cytological diagnosis into a general category. This proposed scheme provides terminology that standardizes the category of the various diseases of the pancreas, some of which are difficult to diagnose specifically by cytology. In addition, this terminology scheme attempts to provide maximum flexibility for patient management, which has become increasingly conservative for some neoplasms. Diagn.

@article{gobee:2011anatomicaltermsinfo,
  abstract = {The many synonyms for anatomical structures confuse medical students and complicate medical communication. Easily accessible translations would alleviate this problem. None of the presently available resources—Terminologia Anatomica (TA), digital terminologies such as the Foundational Model of Anatomy (FMA), and websites—are fully satisfactory to this aim. Internet technologies offer new possibilities to solve the problem. Several authors have called for an online TA. An online translation resource should be easily accessible, user-friendly, comprehensive, expandable, and its quality determinable. As first step towards this goal, we built a translation website that we named www.AnatomicalTerms.info, based on the database of the FMA. It translates between English, Latin, eponyms, and to a lesser extent other languages, and presently contains over 31,000 terms for 7,250 structures, covering 95\% of TA. In addition, it automatically presents searches for images, documents and anatomical variations regarding the sought structure. Several terminological and conceptual issues were encountered in transferring data from TA and FMA into AnatomicalTerms.info, resultant from these resources' different set-ups (paper versus digital) and targets (machine versus human-user). To the best of our knowledge, AnatomicalTerms.info is unique in its combination of user-friendliness and comprehensiveness. As next step, wiki-like expandability will be added to enable open contribution of clinical synonyms and terms in different languages. Specific quality measures will be taken to strike a balance between open contribution and quality assurance. AnatomicalTerms.info's mechanism that “translates” terms to structures furthermore may enhance targeted searching by linking images, descriptions, and other anatomical resources to the structures.

Based on our studies we suggest that the term articulation femoropatellaris should be introduced in the new anatomic terminology, because of the importance of this entity in the function and pathology of the knee joint. In order to indicate that the condylar surfaces, having a different function are separated from the patellar surface of the femur, the term “linea condylopatellaris medialis and linea condylopatellaris lateralis” should be introduced in the anatomical terminology.

The term “nodus lymphoideus” should be changed to nodus lymphaticus because the adjective lymphaticus means belonging to the node in question while the adjective lymphoideus means “similar”, which is not correct.},

This study examines the association of etymological knowledge of A\&P terms and A\&P course performance among 446 undergraduates in their first semester of the study of human gross anatomy and physiology, with a more detailed analysis of the characteristics of 52 students who filled out surveys about their prior knowledge and experiences related to medicine or anatomy. In both data sets, there was only a weak positive correlation between the performance on a quiz of Latin and Greek medical terms and the students' performance on regular assignments. The presumption that familiarity with Latin and Greek word roots has a strong influence on successful learning of anatomy is not supported by these data. Future research should address whether or not there are particular skills associated with using etymological knowledge in improving A\&P course performance.

@article{smith:2007latin,
  abstract = {Background: Medical students and practitioners learn and use a vocabulary originating almost entirely from classical Latin and Greek languages. Previous generations required Latin or Greek prior to medical school, but the current generation does not have such requirements. Anecdotal evidence suggests that understanding Latin or Greek helps students to learn and practitioners to recall otherwise foreign terminology. This study evaluated students' familiarity with Latin and Greek etymologies before and after a gross anatomy course that incorporated etymologies into its curriculum. Methods: First-year medical students at Mayo Clinic College of Medicine were taught Latin and Greek etymologies through lectures and handouts during their gross anatomy course. They took a pretest and a posttest before and after the course to assess their understanding of etymologies. In addition, students from all four years of medical school, residents, and staff physicians also took a general etymology quiz to assess their understanding of etymologies. Results: After their gross anatomy course emphasizing etymologies, first-year students scored higher on the posttest than they did on the pretest. First-year students also reported that learning etymologies enhanced anatomy learning, made the experience more enjoyable, and proved to be less difficult than they thought it would be prior to the course. Medical students, residents, and staff physicians scored almost equally on the general etymology quiz and almost equally reported that etymologies enhanced learning and recalling terminology. Medical students, residents, and staff physicians almost equally endorsed incorporating etymologies into medical education. Conclusions: This study provides novel scientific evidence that a basic understanding of Latin and Greek etymologies enhances performance and comfort when learning and using medical terminology.
