# Course description

The natural sciences, and the life sciences in particular, employ an enormous vocabulary of technical terms that present a sizeable challenge to the beginning student. The complexity of these terms is owed in part to the fact that many were formed from Greek and Latin words, in order to allow for easier communication within a multilingual scientific community at a time when most of its members learned these languages as a core part of their education. Although most students of the sciences are no longer expected to learn classical languages, a basic exposure to the Latin and Greek elements of scientific language can make it much easier to understand the meaning of technical terms and to expand one’s scientific vocabulary.

No previous knowledge of Greek or Latin is expected of students.

## Learning goals

- Acquire a working vocabulary of the fundamental Greek and Latin roots, prefixes, and suffixes key to understanding scientific terms.
- Develop competency in using unfamiliar words to communicate and comprehend scientific results in oral and written contexts.
- Gain the skills necessary to identify the Greek and Latin elements of scientific terminology and give their meaning.
- Understand the historical processes leading to the development of current scientific terminology.

# Assignments

Assessment is based on a series of tests, in which you will demonstrate your knowledge of Latin and Greek word forms as applied to scientific terminology, and written assignments, in which you will demonstrate your ability to engage with scientific literature. These are weighted as follows:

- Test I (24 July): 20%
- Test II (7 August): 20%
- Pre-Lecture Analyses of Article Vocabulary: 10%
- In-Depth Analysis of Article Vocabulary (due 14 August): 15%
- Final Exam: 35%

No late assignments will be accepted without advance permission from the instructor.

## Tests and final exam

Two general etymology tests will be given over the course of the term, in which you will analyse a set of words and give the meanings of their elements. The vocabulary for these tests will be drawn entirely from the master wordlist distributed to the class (which are derived from articles in your weekly readings and the books listed below under ‘Other Learning Resources’). The final exam (cumulative) will combine these elements with discussions of terminology in passages from scientific articles, and short-answer questions on the historical development of scientific terminology.

## Pre-lecture analyses of article vocabulary

During each lecture, we will dissect the terminology of two peer-reviewed scientific articles. Before class, skim one of the articles (to which links will be supplied on the Learning Portal) and make a list of ten words that you find unusual and appear to you to be based on Greek or Latin. Break down one of these words into its constituent roots based on the etymologies provided in dictionaries (please indicate which you are using). This must be submitted through the Learning Portal **by 11:59 pm the night before each class**. We will analyse these words during class the following day.

## In-depth analysis of article vocabulary

This assignment builds on your weekly experience examining vocabulary from journals. Select twenty terms from two recent (2014) articles in peer-reviewed scientific journals, and analyse their etymology and meaning. You should use at least three different dictionaries (or other scholarly sources) to support your findings. Articles must be fully cited using either the author-date system of the [*Chicago Manual of Style*](http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/) (used in this syllabus) or another style relevant to your discipline.

# Readings

There is no required textbook for this course. All readings are available as PDFs through the Learning Portal; these supplement the lectures by providing historical background on the development of scientific terminology and some points of grammar. Questions on the history of science based on these readings will appear on the tests and final exam.

You will want to ensure that you have access to an English dictionary and a medical dictionary, both of which should have strong coverage of etymologies. The [*Oxford English Dictionary*](http://www.oed.com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca) is excellent, but often more detailed than what you strictly need for this course. For quick reference, I would recommend @stevenson:2010oxford, available through [Oxford Dictionaries](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com) with recordings of pronunciation (also included with Mac OS X). For a medical dictionary, @venes:2013taber is available in the library's reference collection (and, in theory, [available online through the library](http://lib.myilibrary.com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/Open.aspx?id=214017), but the format is very difficult to use). Both titles are available through the bookstore as recommended purchases, and are excellent investments.

You may wish to make use of two books on reserve at the UTM Library: @ayers:1972bioscientific is the source for most of this course's vocabulary and structure for presenting concepts from Greek and Latin, while @haubrich:2003medical is a useful reference tool for examining the origins of medical words.

Also in the library's reference collection, @liddell:1996greek and @lewis:1879latin are two of the most comprehensive dictionaries of Greek and Latin ([available online through Logeion](http://logeion.uchicago.edu)), while @glare:1982oxford is a more recent Latin dictionary. These books will be used during class, and you will need them for the in-depth analysis of article vocabulary.
