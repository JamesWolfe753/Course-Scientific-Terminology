  <h3 id="communication">Communication</h3>
<p>You are always welcome to drop by with questions during office hours. I will respond to email messages within 48 hours. Official course announcements will be sent occasionally to your University of Toronto email address.</p>
<h3 id="missed-tests-and-deferrals">Missed tests and deferrals</h3>
<p>You may be exempted from a term test only in cases of medical or personal emergencies. Absences must be reported online through ROSI, and you must notify me via email with a medical certificate or other appropriate documentation <strong>within three days of the event</strong>. The weight of the excused test will be distributed equally between other assignments and tests. If you require a deferral of the final exam, you must file a <a href="http://www.utm.utoronto.ca/registrar/current-students/petitions">petition with the Office of the Registrar</a>.</p>
<h4 id="notice-of-collection">Notice of collection</h4>
<p><em>The University of Toronto respects your privacy. Personal information is collected pursuant to section 2(14) of the University of Toronto Act, 1971. It is collected for the purpose of administering accommodations for academic purposes based on medical grounds. The department will maintain a record of all medical certificates received. At all times your information will be protected in accordance with the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act.</em></p>
<h3 id="late-work">Late work</h3>
<p>Weekly vocabulary assignments will not be accepted late; one will be automatically excused for all students. The final vocabulary paper will only be accepted after the deadline with prior permission (which must be requested at least two days in advance via email).</p>
<h3 id="academic-integrity">Academic integrity</h3>
<p>Academic integrity is fundamental to learning and scholarship. You are expected to know and follow the University of Toronto’s <a href="http://www.governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/policies/studentc.htm">Code of Student Conduct</a> and <a href="http://www.governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/policies/behaveac.htm">Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters</a>.</p>
<p>Normally, students will be required to submit their course essays to <a href="http://www.turnitin.com">Turnitin.com</a> for a review of textual similarity and detection of possible plagiarism. In doing so, students will allow their essays to be included as source documents in the Turnitin.com reference database, where they will be used solely for the purpose of detecting plagiarism. The terms that apply to the University’s use of the Turnitin.com service are described on the Turnitin.com website.</p>
<h3 id="accommodations">Accommodations</h3>
<p>If you are a student with a disability or health consideration and need academic accommodations, please see me and contact the <a href="http://www.utm.utoronto.ca/accessability/">AccessAbility Resource Centre</a> as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.utm.utoronto.ca/asc/undergraduate-students">Academic Skills Centre</a> is also available to all students, and offers a full range of workshops, seminars and individual consultations.</p>
