# Latin and Greek in Scientific Terminology (CLA201)

This repository provides the materials for the versions of this course taught by [Andrew Dunning](http://individual.utoronto.ca/dunning/) at the University of Toronto in Summer and Fall 2014. This attempts to make the material more accessible and current by building on one of the textbooks traditionally used at Toronto, by Donald M. Ayers, *Bioscientific Terminology: Words from Latin and Greek Stems* (Tucson: University of Arizona Press, 1972), supplementing its contents with a selection of recent articles on scientific nomenclature. While this book is dated, more recent works are written either for a course on Greek and Latin in medical (mostly anatomical) terminology, or one that provides a very general introduction to the classical roots of English words that is not focused on the sciences (see the bibliography under 'Guides' for a listing). It is largely students from life sciences that enrol in the course, but it is also frequently attended by those from other fields.

The appearance of the vocabulary lists is made possible through a set of slides generously provided by John MacCormick (Department of Classics, University of Toronto), which he produced for a version of the course taught in 2012. These are updated and modified from Ayers to correct some errors, provide better definitions, update some concepts, and consistently meet the standards of Canadian/British spelling; nonetheless, the basic structure of the original has been retained in order to allow students to use these lists seamlessly with the additional descriptions, exercises, and examples found in Ayers' book. Some other ideas are taken from course websites created by [John Traill](http://projects.chass.utoronto.ca/attica/cla201.htm) and [Catherine Rubincam](http://erin.utoronto.ca/~w3cla201/).

## Technical Information

The website is displayed using GitHub Pages. (Further material was also provided to students using the university's [Learning Portal](https://portal.utoronto.ca).) The syllabus, vocabulary list, and lecture notes are converted from Markdown into PDF, Word format, and HTML slides (with [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/)) using John MacFarlane's wonderful [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/). References are managed using [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org), with the [Zotxt](https://bitbucket.org/egh/zotxt) add-on.

Others can create their own improved versions of this course (see [How to Fork a Syllabus on GitHub](http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/how-to-fork-a-syllabus-on-github/39447)). Any corrections are most welcome.
