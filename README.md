This repository provides the materials for the versions of this course taught by [Andrew Dunning](http://individual.utoronto.ca/dunning/) at the University of Toronto in Summer and Fall 2014 (CLA201H5S, CLA201H5F).

## Technical Information

The syllabus, vocabulary list, and lecture notes are converted from Markdown into PDF, Word format, and HTML slides (with [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/)) using John MacFarlane's wonderful [Pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/). References are managed using [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org), with the [Zotxt](https://bitbucket.org/egh/zotxt) add-on. The website is built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

Others are welcome to create their own improved versions of this course (see [How to Fork a Syllabus on GitHub](http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/how-to-fork-a-syllabus-on-github/39447)); any corrections are most welcome. (If you simply wish to reuse the website design, you should go back to the [original by Lincoln Mullen](https://github.com/lmullen/clio3-syllabus).)
