    "body": "# Course description\r\n\r\nThe natural sciences, and the life sciences in particular, employ an enormous vocabulary of technical terms that present a sizeable challenge to the beginning student. The complexity of these terms is owed in part to the fact that many were formed from Greek and Latin words, in order to allow for easier communication within a multilingual scientific community at a time when most of its members learned these languages as a core part of their education. Although most students of the sciences are no longer expected to learn classical languages, a basic exposure to the Latin and Greek elements of scientific language can make it much easier to understand the meaning of technical terms and to expand one\u2019s scientific vocabulary.\r\n\r\nNo previous knowledge of Greek or Latin is expected of students.\r\n\r\n## Learning goals\r\n\r\n- Acquire a working vocabulary of the fundamental Greek and Latin roots, prefixes, and suffixes key to understanding scientific terms.\r\n- Develop competency in using unfamiliar words to communicate and comprehend scientific results in oral and written contexts.\r\n- Gain the skills necessary to identify the Greek and Latin elements of scientific terminology and give their meaning.\r\n- Understand the historical processes leading to the development of current scientific terminology.\r\n\r\n# Assignments\r\n\r\nAssessment is based on a series of tests, in which you will demonstrate your knowledge of Latin and Greek word forms as applied to scientific terminology, and written assignments, in which you will demonstrate your ability to engage with scientific literature. These are weighted as follows:\r\n\r\n- Test I (24 July): 20%\r\n- Test II (7 August): 20%\r\n- Pre-Lecture Analyses of Article Vocabulary: 10%\r\n- In-Depth Analysis of Article Vocabulary (due 14 August): 15%\r\n- Final Exam: 35%\r\n\r\nNo late assignments will be accepted without advance permission from the instructor.\r\n\r\n## Tests and final exam\r\n\r\nTwo general etymology tests will be given over the course of the term, in which you will analyse a set of words and give the meanings of their elements. The vocabulary for these tests will be drawn entirely from the master wordlist distributed to the class (which are derived from articles in your weekly readings and the books listed below under \u2018Other Learning Resources\u2019). The final exam (cumulative) will combine these elements with discussions of terminology in passages from scientific articles, and short-answer questions on the historical development of scientific terminology.\r\n\r\n## Pre-lecture analyses of article vocabulary\r\n\r\nDuring each lecture, we will dissect the terminology of two peer-reviewed scientific articles. Before class, skim one of the articles (to which links will be supplied on the Learning Portal) and make a list of ten words that you find unusual and appear to you to be based on Greek or Latin. Break down one of these words into its constituent roots based on the etymologies provided in dictionaries (please indicate which you are using). This must be submitted through the Learning Portal **by 11:59 pm the night before each class**. We will analyse these words during class the following day.\r\n\r\n## In-depth analysis of article vocabulary\r\n\r\nThis assignment builds on your weekly experience examining vocabulary from journals. Select twenty terms from two recent (2014) articles in peer-reviewed scientific journals, and analyse their etymology and meaning. You should use at least three different dictionaries (or other scholarly sources) to support your findings. Articles must be fully cited using either the author-date system of the [*Chicago Manual of Style*](http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/) (used in this syllabus) or another style relevant to your discipline.\r\n\r\n# Readings\r\n\r\nThere is no required textbook for this course. All readings are available as PDFs through the Learning Portal; these supplement the lectures by providing historical background on the development of scientific terminology and some points of grammar. Questions on the history of science based on these readings will appear on the tests and final exam.\r\n\r\nYou will want to ensure that you have access to an English dictionary and a medical dictionary, both of which should have strong coverage of etymologies. The [*Oxford English Dictionary*](http://www.oed.com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca) is excellent, but often more detailed than what you strictly need for this course. For quick reference, I would recommend @stevenson:2010oxford, available through [Oxford Dictionaries](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com) with recordings of pronunciation (also included with Mac OS X). For a medical dictionary, @venes:2013taber is available in the library's reference collection (and, in theory, [available online through the library](http://lib.myilibrary.com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/Open.aspx?id=214017), but the format is very difficult to use). Both titles are available through the bookstore as recommended purchases, and are excellent investments.\r\n\r\nYou may wish to make use of two books on reserve at the UTM Library: @ayers:1972bioscientific is the source for most of this course's vocabulary and structure for presenting concepts from Greek and Latin, while @haubrich:2003medical is a useful reference tool for examining the origins of medical words.\r\n\r\nAlso in the library's reference collection, @liddell:1996greek and @lewis:1879latin are two of the most comprehensive dictionaries of Greek and Latin ([available online through Logeion](http://logeion.uchicago.edu)), while @glare:1982oxford is a more recent Latin dictionary. These books will be used during class, and you will need them for the in-depth analysis of article vocabulary.\r\n\r\n# Schedule\r\n\r\n## Part I: Scientific terms from Greek\r\n\r\n### 1.

Please ensure that the course code (CLA201) is included in the subject line, and that you sign your message with your full name. I will respond to all messages within 48 hours.\r\n\r\n# Missed and late assignments or tests\r\n\r\nTests and assignments may be excused only in cases of medical or personal emergencies. Within one week of the event, absences must be reported online through ROSI, and in addition to notifying me via email.

The in-depth analysis of article vocabulary will only be accepted after the deadline with prior permission (which must be requested at least two days in advance via email).\r\n\r\n# Academic integrity\r\n\r\nAcademic integrity is fundamental to learning and scholarship; for a recent example of its importance to the sciences, see @garner:2014case. Participating honestly, respectfully, responsibly, and fairly in this academic community ensures that the University of Toronto degree that you earn will be valued as a true indication of your individual academic achievement, and will continue to receive the respect and recognition it deserves. Potential offences include, but are not limited to:\r\n\r\n## In papers and assignments\r\n- Using someone else\u2019s ideas or words without appropriate acknowledgement.\r\n- Copying material word-for-word from a source (including lecture and study group notes) and not placing the words within quotation marks.\r\n- Submitting your own work in more than one course without the permission of the instructor.\r\n- Making up sources or facts.\r\n- Including references to sources that you did not use.\r\n- Obtaining or providing unauthorized assistance on any assignment, including working in groups on assignments that are supposed to be individual work or having someone rewrite or add material to your work while 'editing'.\r\n- Lending your work to a classmate who submits it as his/her own without your permission.\r\n\r\n## On tests and exams\r\n- Using or possessing any unauthorized aid, including a cell phone.\r\n- Looking at someone else\u2019s answers\r\n- Letting someone else look at your answers.\r\n- Misrepresenting your identity.\r\n- Submitting an altered test for re-grading.\r\n\r\n## Misrepresentation\r\n- Falsifying or altering any documentation required by the University, including doctor\u2019s notes. \r\n- Falsifying institutional documents or grades.\r\n\r\nThe University of Toronto treats cases of academic misconduct very seriously. All suspected cases of academic dishonesty will be investigated following the procedures outlined in the University of Toronto\u2019s [Code of Behaviour on Academic Matters](http://www.governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/policies/behaveac.htm). The consequences for academic misconduct can be severe, including a failure in the course and a notation on your transcript.
