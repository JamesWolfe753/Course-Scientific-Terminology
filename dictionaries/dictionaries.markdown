The *Oxford English Dictionary*is the most accessible and accurate resource for detailed information on the meaning and origins of words, and is updated continuously in its online form, which can be accessed through the library at <http://www.oed.com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/>. Nonetheless, some of its entries have not been recently updated (some have escaped revision for over a hundred years), and it sometimes provides more specialized information than you need for a basic understanding of a word. For simplified definitions and etymologies, and for checking current spelling, you may instead wish to use the *Oxford Dictionary of English,* which is both freely available online (with recordings of word pronunciation) and included with Mac OS X and iOS. There are also a number of other reliable dictionaries that include etymologies.

The *Oxford Latin Dictionary* is the most up-to-date and accurate Latin-English dictionary, but is not yet available online, and does not include authors beyond the second century. Although the second edition is easier to use, its contents are mostly unchanged from the first edition (published between 1968 and 1982). It is usefully supplemented by the *Dictionary of Medieval Latin from British Sources,* which provides a much larger range of scientific vocabulary, and is expected to be made available online in the coming months. For many purposes, however, Lewis and Short’s *Latin Dictionary* is still the quickest reference tool. Both this and Liddell and Scott’s *Greek-English Lexicon* (except for its 1996 supplement) have long passed out of copyright and are available through a number of online sources, notably in a combined form at <http://logeion.uchicago.edu/>.
