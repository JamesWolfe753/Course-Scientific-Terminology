title: Vocabulary Analysis Paper
...

This assignment builds on your weekly experience examining vocabulary from journals. Select twenty terms from two recent (2014) articles in peer-reviewed scientific journals, and analyse their etymology and meaning. You should use at least three different dictionaries (or other scholarly sources) to support your findings. You must fully cite the dictionaries and other sources used using author-date system of the [*Chicago Manual of Style*](http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/) (used in the syllabus) or another style relevant to your discipline.

The assignment will only be accepted after the deadline with prior permission (which must be requested at least two days in advance via email).

### Sources for Articles

If you have absolutely no idea where to find peer-reviewed articles from which to take your words, some of the most accessible scientific articles can be found in [*PLoS ONE*](http://www.plosone.org) (or [another PLoS journal](http://www.plos.org/publications/journals/)) and [*PeerJ*](http://peerj.com) (but do not use a pre-print from the latter, as these are pending review). Another very popular science journal is [*Nature*](http://nature.com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca), but be careful to select a work from their 'articles' section, as the journal contains both peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed material. Select anything at all that interests you published in 2014. (The articles in the bibliographies posted on the Learning Portal are for your research, and not intended as sources for words.) Be sure to provide in the paper a citation of the article you are using, including a link.

### Steps to Writing the Paper

After you have found two articles that (hopefully) interest you, choose twenty Latin- or Greek-derived words from the articles you selected. Try to give yourself a bit of a challenge, looking up technical as well as common words.

I would recommend looking each of these words up in at least two sources, to be safe (remember that you must use at least three peer-reviewed sources for researching the assignment), though it's not required. Make note of the Latin/Greek stems of the word, being sure to make a citation for everything.

### Sources for Etymologies

To find your minimum three scholarly works for researching the words, you can use the bibliographies posted in the Course Materials, which contain full citations of scholarly materials appropriate for your purposes, including the foundational articles used as the course readings, the dictionaries, historical articles, and other guides to Latin/Greek scientific terminology (the latter category probably won't be very helpful, as little of the material is online). If you wish to use something else, ensure that it was produced by an academic publisher (e.g. Oxford University Press). These are the sources that are most readily accessible, with their recommended abbreviations:

 - Lewis and Short's *Latin Dictionary* [L&S or @lewis:1879latin], on [Logeion](http://logeion.uchicago.edu);
 - Liddell and Scott's *Greek Lexicon* [LSJ or @liddell:1940greek], also on [Logeion](http://logeion.uchicago.edu) (note that, even though these two dictionaries are on the same site, they count as separate sources);
 - the [*Oxford English Dictionary*](http://oed.com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/) [*OED* or @simpson:1989oxford];
 - the [*Oxford Dictionary of English*](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com)  [*ODE* or @stevenson:2010oxford];
 - the *Oxford Latin Dictionary* [*OLD* or @glare:1982oxford], in the library's reference collection;
 - [*Stedman's Medical Dictionary*](http://link.library.utoronto.ca/eir/EIRdetail.cfm?Resources__ID=14615) [*Stedman's* or @stegman:2006stedman];
 - [*Taber's Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary*](http://lib.myilibrary.com.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/Open.aspx?id=214017) [*Taber's* or @venes:2013taber];
 - Haubrich's *Medical Meanings*, on the course reserve [@haubrich:2003medical]; and
 - *Elsevier's Dictionary of Chemoetymology* [@senning:2007elsevier], in the library's reference collection.
 
Note that the *Oxford English Dictionary* and *Oxford Dictionary of English* are largely written from the same sources, and therefore cannot be used to verify one another; only one of these should be cited in investigating a given word. The more detailed *OED* should be preferred, resorting to the *ODE* only for cases of modern technical vocabulary that has not yet been included in the *OED*.
 
The articles in the online bibliography may be useful for more specific topics (for example, there are specific works dedicated to the etymology of the larynx or cardiologic anatomical terminology that might save you a lot of time if you are dealing articles one of these fields).

### Format

The assignment should be written using formal prose rather than being point-form.

All you strictly need for each word is a statement of the English definition, a list of the Latin and Greek elements from which the word is derived, and the definitions of these elements. Make note of any interesting differences in meaning, and if you can easily find an account for the changes between classical to modern times, this might also be interesting. This is the part where you can show off some originality.

As a model for ideal writing style and organization, glance over @cascarini:2007mandibular or @cooper:2008maxillary. @soutis:2006ancient is also a good example of how to discuss the etymologies of words, but your assignment need not be so in-depth as this. Unlike these examples, however, please provide a specific citation of the dictionaries used for each word.

### Citing your Sources

You can use any citation style you like as long as you're consistent (I recommend Chicago author-date), as long as you record at a minimum a reference to the book/article and a locator. You can put this information either in brackets or in a footnote. You could, for instance, write (Davis et al. 2014, 1099) if you were using p. 1099 of the article on the naming of the cranial nerves; citing a dictionary, you might put (*OED* s.v. 'cranial') or (*Taber's* s.v. 'cranial'). The abbreviation 's.v.' means 'sub verbo', or 'under the word', indicating the word you looked up in a dictionary or encyclopedia to find the information. See the *Chicago Manual of Style* if you have more questions on information required in citations. I recommend using a reference manager such as [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org).

### Checklist

Ensure that you have met these criteria when submitting the assignment:

- Twenty words with Greek or Latin elements have been selected from any two articles published since the beginning of 2014 in peer-reviewed science journals. Citations with links have been provided for each.
- The English definition of each of these words has been provided, together with a list of the Greek and Latin word elements, and definitions of these elements. Any difference between the English and Greek/Latin meanings of the word has been noted.
- The information for your word derivations has been drawn from at least three different scholarly sources (e.g. the Oxford English Dictionary, Taber's, Liddell and Scott, Lewis and Short).
- The paper is written in a prose format and thoughtfully organized.
- You have provided complete citations for all material.
