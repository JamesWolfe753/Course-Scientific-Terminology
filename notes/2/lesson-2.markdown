# Introduction

## Last Time

- Examined the content of the course (everything is on the syllabus).
- Went through the Greek alphabet (we will be looking at its transliteration today).
- Introduced common Greek prefixes.
- Looked at Turmezei (2012).

## This Class

- Learning how to read Greek using words you already know.
- Looking at adjective-forming suffixes.
- Introducing more base forms.
- Examining compound suffixes.

## Turmezei (2012)

- Explained that about 89 per cent of anatomical vocabulary comes from Greek and Latin.
    - Breakdown: Classical Latin (62%), Classical Greek (24%), Old English (7%), Post-Classical Latin (3%), other (4%).
- Gives you a sense of how words are formed through various examples.

## Learning Strategies

- Flashcards are really good for memorizing vocabulary.
- Speaking words aloud can make them easier to recall.
- Rehearse vocabulary even in spare moments (on the bus, in the shower, while you’re doing the dishes).

---

- Make sure you think about meaning. When you’re learning the elements of a word and its definition, consider what the elements of a word have to do with its meaning. This way, your recall will be better and the you’ll remember the word for longer.

# Adjective-Forming Suffixes

## What is a suffix?

- Suffixes attach to bases, and appear at the end of the word. Like prefixes, they modify the meaning of a base, conveying a little more information.
- They differ from prefixes in their position, but also in that they determine the word’s part of speech. We will see bases that form adjectives, nouns and verbs.
- Džuganová (1998) provides a full overview of the possibilities for affixation.

## New Suffixes

- More than one suffix (or prefix) can be found in a single word.

## LOG, ‘reason’ + -ic, ‘pertaining to’ = Logic
- LOG, ‘reason’ + -ic, ‘pertaining to’ + -al, ‘pertaining to’ = logical (‘pertaining to / having to do with what pertains to reasoning’)

## -al, ‘pertaining to’, ‘like’, ‘belonging to’, ‘having the character of’
- BIO- ‘life’ + -logy, ‘science of’ + ic + al 

## -an (-ian), ‘pertaining to’, ‘like’, ‘one connected with’
- amphi-, ‘both’ + BI-, ‘life’ + -ian
- PROTO-, ‘first’ + ZO-, ‘life’ + -an
- THE, ‘god’ + -logy, ‘study of’ + -an

## -ous (-ious), ‘full of’, ‘having’, ‘pertaining to’, ‘like’
- amphi- + BI-, ‘life’ + -ous
- syn- + ONYM-, ‘name’ + -ous
- HOMO-, ‘same’ + GENE-, ‘kind’ + -ous

## -ic, -tic, (-ac after -i), ‘pertaining to’, ‘like’
- GASTR-, ‘stomach’ + -ic
- STA-, ‘to stand’ + -ic
- CARDI-, ‘heart’ + -ac

## -ics, -tics, ‘art, science or study of’
- PHYS-, ‘nature’ + -ics
- GENE-, ‘to be produced’ + -tics
- PED, ‘child’ + IATR-, ‘doctor’ + -ics

## -oid, -ode, ‘like’, ‘having the shape of’
- SPHER-, ‘sphere’ + -oid
- ADEN-, ‘gland’ + -oid
- NEMAT-, ‘thread’ + -ode
- PHYLL-, ‘leaf’ + -ode

# Inflected Languages

## Inflection

- Both Greek and Latin are *inflected languages*, which means that they can express part of their meaning through a change in the final syllable of a word.

## Conjugation

- Changing the form of a verb to show its function.
- This is found to a limited degree in English.
    - I *love*, you *love*, but he *loves*.
- This is even more common in French.
    - *J'aime* means 'I love', *tu aimes* is 'you love', and so forth. The verb 'aimer' changes its form based on the person, number, mood, and tense.

## Declension

- Varying the form of a noun, pronoun, or adjective, in order to indicate grammatical number, gender, and case.

## Cases

- A form that a noun, adjective, or pronoun can take in order to express its relationship to other words in the sentence.
- There are very limited remnants of this in English:
    - *Who* must always be the subject of the sentence. ('Who is getting married?')
    - *Whom* must be the object. ('Whom did he marry?')
    - *Whose* is a possesive. ('Whose wedding is he attending?')
