# Last Time

## The Greek Alphabet

- For our test on 24 July, you should be able to recognize words written in Greek (e.g. πλαγκτόν) and be able to write out the transliterated form (plankton).
    - You do not need to know how breathing marks work.
- Remember: γ before γ, κ, ξ, or χ becomes *n*, not *g*:
    - σπόγγος = *spongos* (sponge)
- When a word has what appears to be an opening single quotation mark above a letter, it uses an h- sound.
    - ἱπποπόταμος = *hippopotamos* (hippopotamus)

## Adjective-Forming Suffixes

- Suffixes attach to bases, and appear at the end of the word. Like prefixes, they modify the meaning of a base, conveying a little more information.
- They differ from prefixes in their position, but also in that they determine the word’s part of speech. We will see bases that form adjectives, nouns and verbs.
- Džuganová (1998) provides a full overview of the possibilities for affixation.

## Compound Suffixes

- Compound suffixes actually contain bases within them, some of which you’ve already learned, but the appear so frequently in this form that it is useful to treat them as suffixes themselves.
    - E.g., LOG + y = -logy

# Inflected Languages

## Inflection

- Both Greek and Latin are *inflected languages*, which means that they can express part of their meaning through a change in the final syllable of a word.

## Conjugation

- Changing the form of a verb to show its function.
- This is found to a limited degree in English.
    - I *love*, you *love*, but he *loves*.
- This is even more common in French.
    - *J'aime* means 'I love', *tu aimes* is 'you love', and so forth. The verb 'aimer' changes its form based on the person, number, mood, and tense.

## Declension

- Varying the form of a noun, pronoun, or adjective, in order to indicate grammatical number, gender, and case.

## Cases

- A form that a noun, adjective, or pronoun can take in order to express its relationship to other words in the sentence.
- There are very limited remnants of this in English:
    - *Who* must always be the subject of the sentence. ('Who is getting married?')
    - *Whom* must be the object. ('Whom did he marry?')
    - *Whose* is a possesive. ('Whose wedding is he attending?')
    
### Practice test

A full-length practice test, and a separate answer key for the practice test, will appear on Blackboard sometime tomorrow. This is just for your own benefit, and is not a class assignment.

## Why 'advertise' and not 'advertize'?

- In the United Kingdom, words that we spell -ize [are often spelled -ise](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/words/ize-ise-or-yse) (e.g. *organise* rather than *organize*).
- 

There is a small set of verbs that must always be spelled with -ise at the end and never with -ize. The main reason for this is that, in these words, -ise is part of a longer word element rather than being a separate ending in its own right. For example: -cise (meaning ‘cutting’) in the word excise; -prise (meaning ‘taking’) as in surprise; or –mise (meaning ‘sending’) as in promise. Here are the most common ones:

- advertise
- advise
- apprise
- arise
- chastise
- comprise
- compromise
- despise
- devise
- disguise
- enterprise
- excise
- exercise
- improvise
- incise
- merchandise
- prise (meaning ‘open’)
- promise
- revise
- supervise
- surmise
- surprise
- televise


 

There are also a few verbs which always end in -yse in British English (or optionally -yze in Canadian English):

- analyse
- breathalyse
- catalyse
- dialyse
- electrolyse
- hydrolyse
- paralyse
- psychoanalyse
